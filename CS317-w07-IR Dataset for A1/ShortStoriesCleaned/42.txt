a
tripping
tongue
natalya
mihalovna
a
young
married
lady
who
had
arrived
in
the
morning
from
yalta
was
having
her
dinner
and
in
a
neverceasing
flow
of
babble
was
telling
her
husband
of
all
the
charms
of
the
crimea
her
husband
delighted
gazed
tenderly
at
her
enthusiastic
face
listened
and
from
time
to
time
put
in
a
question
but
they
say
living
is
dreadfully
expensive
there
he
asked
among
other
things
well
what
shall
i
say
to
my
thinking
this
talk
of
its
being
so
expensive
is
exaggerated
hubby
the
devil
is
not
as
black
as
he
is
painted
yulia
petrovna
and
i
for
instance
had
very
decent
and
comfortable
rooms
for
twenty
roubles
a
day
everything
depends
on
knowing
how
to
do
things
my
dear
of
course
if
you
want
to
go
up
into
the
mountains
to
aiepetri
for
instance
if
you
take
a
horse
a
guide
then
of
course
it
does
come
to
something
its
awful
what
it
comes
to
but
vassitchka
the
mountains
there
imagine
high
high
mountains
a
thousand
times
higher
than
the
church
at
the
topmist
mist
mist
at
the
bottom
enormous
stones
stones
stones
and
pines
ah
i
cant
bear
to
think
of
it
by
the
way
i
read
about
those
tatar
guides
there
in
some
magazine
while
you
were
away
such
abominable
stories
tell
me
is
there
really
anything
out
of
the
way
about
them
natalya
mihalovna
made
a
little
disdainful
grimace
and
shook
her
head
just
ordinary
tatars
nothing
special
she
said
though
indeed
i
only
had
a
glimpse
of
them
in
the
distance
they
were
pointed
out
to
me
but
i
did
not
take
much
notice
of
them
you
know
hubby
i
always
had
a
prejudice
against
all
such
circassians
greeks
moors
they
are
said
to
be
terrible
don
juans
perhaps
there
are
shameless
creatures
who
natalya
mihalovna
suddenly
jumped
up
from
her
chair
as
though
she
had
thought
of
something
dreadful
for
half
a
minute
she
looked
with
frightened
eyes
at
her
husband
and
said
accentuating
each
word
vassitchka
i
say
the
immoral
women
there
are
in
the
world
ah
how
immoral
and
its
not
as
though
they
were
workingclass
or
middleclass
people
but
aristocratic
ladies
priding
themselves
on
their
bonton
it
was
simply
awful
i
could
not
believe
my
own
eyes
i
shall
remember
it
as
long
as
i
live
to
think
that
people
can
forget
themselves
to
such
a
point
as
ach
vassitchka
i
dont
like
to
speak
of
it
take
my
companion
yulia
petrovna
for
example
such
a
good
husband
two
children
she
moves
in
a
decent
circle
always
poses
as
a
saintand
all
at
once
would
you
believe
it
only
hubby
of
course
this
is
entre
nous
give
me
your
word
of
honour
you
wont
tell
a
soul
what
next
of
course
i
wont
tell
honour
bright
mind
now
i
trust
you
the
little
lady
put
down
her
fork
assumed
a
mysterious
air
and
whispered
imagine
a
thing
like
this
that
yulia
petrovna
rode
up
into
the
mountains
it
was
glorious
weather
she
rode
on
ahead
with
her
guide
i
was
a
little
behind
we
had
ridden
two
or
three
miles
all
at
once
only
fancy
vassitchka
yulia
cried
out
and
clutched
at
her
bosom
her
tatar
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
or
she
would
have
fallen
off
the
saddle
i
rode
up
to
her
with
my
guide
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
oh
she
cried
i
am
dying
i
feel
faint
i
cant
go
any
further
fancy
my
alarm
let
us
go
back
then
i
said
no
natalie
she
said
i
cant
go
back
i
shall
die
of
pain
if
i
move
another
step
i
have
spasms
and
she
prayed
and
besought
my
suleiman
and
me
to
ride
back
to
the
town
and
fetch
her
some
of
her
drops
which
always
do
her
good
stay
i
dont
quite
understand
you
muttered
the
husband
scratching
his
forehead
you
said
just
now
that
you
had
only
seen
those
tatars
from
a
distance
and
now
you
are
talking
of
some
suleiman
there
you
are
finding
fault
again
the
lady
pouted
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
i
cant
endure
suspiciousness
i
cant
endure
it
its
stupid
stupid
i
am
not
finding
fault
but
why
say
what
is
not
true
if
you
rode
about
with
tatars
so
be
it
god
bless
you
but
why
shuffle
about
it
hm
you
are
a
queer
one
cried
the
lady
revolted
he
is
jealous
of
suleiman
as
though
one
could
ride
up
into
the
mountains
without
a
guide
i
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
if
you
dont
know
the
ways
there
if
you
dont
understand
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
yes
hold
your
tongue
you
cant
take
a
step
there
without
a
guide
so
it
seems
none
of
your
silly
grins
if
you
please
i
am
not
a
yulia
i
dont
justify
her
but
i
though
i
dont
pose
as
a
saint
i
dont
forget
myself
to
that
degree
my
suleiman
never
overstepped
the
limits
noo
mametkul
used
to
be
sitting
at
yulias
all
day
long
but
in
my
room
as
soon
as
it
struck
eleven
suleiman
march
off
you
go
and
my
foolish
tatar
boy
would
depart
i
made
him
mind
his
ps
and
qs
hubby
as
soon
as
he
began
grumbling
about
money
or
anything
i
would
say
how
whaat
whaaat
and
his
heart
would
be
in
his
mouth
directly
hahaha
his
eyes
you
know
vassitchka
were
as
black
as
black
like
coals
such
an
amusing
little
tatar
face
so
funny
and
silly
i
kept
him
in
order
didnt
i
just
i
can
fancy
mumbled
her
husband
rolling
up
pellets
of
bread
thats
stupid
vassitchka
i
know
what
is
in
your
mind
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
but
i
assure
you
even
when
we
were
on
our
expeditions
i
never
let
him
overstep
the
limits
for
instance
if
we
rode
to
the
mountains
or
to
the
uchansu
waterfall
i
would
always
say
to
him
suleiman
ride
behind
do
you
hear
and
he
always
rode
behind
poor
boy
even
when
we
even
at
the
most
dramatic
moments
i
would
say
to
him
still
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
only
a
tatar
and
i
am
the
wife
of
a
civil
councillor
haha
the
little
lady
laughed
then
looking
round
her
quickly
and
assuming
an
alarmed
expression
whispered
but
yulia
oh
that
yulia
i
quite
see
vassitchka
there
is
no
reason
why
one
shouldnt
have
a
little
fun
a
little
rest
from
the
emptiness
of
conventional
life
thats
all
right
have
your
fling
by
all
meansno
one
will
blame
you
but
to
take
the
thing
seriously
to
get
up
scenes
no
say
what
you
like
i
cannot
understand
that
just
fancy
she
was
jealous
wasnt
that
silly
one
day
mametkul
her
grande
passion
came
to
see
her
she
was
not
at
home
well
i
asked
him
into
my
room
there
was
conversation
one
thing
and
another
theyre
awfully
amusing
you
know
the
evening
passed
without
our
noticing
it
all
at
once
yulia
rushed
in
she
flew
at
me
and
at
mametkul
made
such
a
scene
fi
i
cant
understand
that
sort
of
thing
vassitchka
vassitchka
cleared
his
throat
frowned
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
you
had
a
gay
time
there
i
must
say
he
growled
with
a
disdainful
smile
how
stuupid
that
is
cried
natalya
mihalovna
offended
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
you
always
have
such
horrid
ideas
i
wont
tell
you
anything

i
wont
the
lady
pouted
and
said
no
more
