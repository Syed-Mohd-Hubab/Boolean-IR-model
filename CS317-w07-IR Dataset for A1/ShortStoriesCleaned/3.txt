long
while

talking
talking
he

fond
meditating
old
age
he
longing
reach
some
haven
reassured
that
he
might
not
so
frightened
dying
he
longing
meekness
spiritual
calm
confidence
himself
such
this
guest
theirs
who
satisfied
hunger
cucumbers
bread
believed
that
doing
so
made
him
more
perfect
he
was
sitting
chest
plump
healthy
keeping
silent
patiently
enduring
boredom
dusk
when
one
glanced
him
from
entry
he
looked
like
big
round
stone
which
one
could
not
move
from
its
place
if
man
something
lay
hold
life
he
right
zhmuhin
went
through
entry
porch
then
he
could
heard
sighing
saying
reflectively
himself
yes
sure
by
now
it
was
dark
here
there
stars
could
seen
sky
they
not
yet
lighted
indoors
someone
came
into
parlour
noiselessly
shadow
stood
still
near
door
it
was
lyubov
osipovna
zhmuhins
wife
you
from

she
asked
timidly
not

younger
one
any
rate

sent
school
it
such
pity
she
said
slowly
there
was
quiver
voice
it
seemed
incredible
that
woman
so
small
so
youthful
could
grown
children
oh
its
such
pity
you
dont
know
anything
about
it
mother
it
not
your

said
zhmuhin
appearing
doorway
dont
pester
our
guest
with
your
wild
talk
go
away
mother
lyubov
osipovna
went
out
entry
repeated
more
thin
little
voice
oh
its
such
pity
bed
was
made
visitor
sofa
parlour
that
it
might
not
dark
him
they
lighted
lamp
before
ikon
zhmuhin
went
bed
own
room
he
lay
there
he
thought
soul
age
recent
stroke
which
so
frightened
him
made
him
think
death
he
was
fond
philosophizing
when
he
was
quietness
by
himself
then
he
fancied
that
he
was
very
earnest
deep
thinker
that
nothing
this
world
interested
him
but
serious
questions
now
he
kept
thinking
he
longed
pitch
upon
some
one
significant
thought
unlike
others
which
would
guide
him
life
he
wanted
think
out
principles
some
sort
himself
so
make
life
deep
earnest
he
imagined
that
he
felt
himself
it
would
good
thing
an
old
man
like
him
abstain
altogether
from
meat
from
superfluities
sorts
time
when
men
give
killing
each
other
animals
would
come
sooner
or
later
it
could
not
but
so
he
imagined
that
time
himself
clearly
pictured
himself
living
peace
with
animals
suddenly
he
thought
again
pigs
everything
was
tangle
brain
its
queer
business
lord
mercy
upon
us
he
muttered
sighing
heavily
you
asleep
he
asked
zhmuhin
got
out
bed
stopped
doorway
with
nothing
but
shirt
displaying
guest
sinewy
legs
that
looked
dry
sticks
nowadays
you
know
he
began
sorts
telegraphs
telephones
marvels
kinds
fact
come
but
people
better
than
they
were
they
say
that

or
forty

coarse
cruel

stifled
he
said
i
will
go
outside
zhmuhin
still
talking
about
women
drew
bolt
entry
they
both
went
out
full
moon
was
floating
sky
just
over
yard
moonlight
house
barn
looked
whiter
than
by
day
grass
brilliant
streaks
moonlight
white
too
stretched
between
black
shadows
far
away
right
could
seen
steppe
above
it
stars
were
softly
glowingand
it
was
mysterious
infinitely
far
away
though
one
were
gazing
into
deep
abyss
while
left
heavy
storm
clouds
black
soot
were
piling
one
upon
another
above
steppe
their
edges
were
lighted
by
moon
it
looked
though
there
were
mountains
there
with
white
snow
their
peaks
dark
forests
sea
there
was
flash
lightning
faint
rumble
thunder
it
seemed
though
battle
were
being
fought
mountains
quite
close
house
little
night
owl
screeched
monotonously
asleep
asleep
what
time
it
now
asked
visitor
just
after
one
how
long
it
still
dawn
they
went
back
house
lay
down
again
it
was
time
sleep
one
usually
sleep
so
splendidly
before
rain
but
old
man
hankering
after
serious
weighty
thoughts
he
wanted
not
simply
think
but
meditate
he
meditated
how
good
it
would
death
was
near
hand
sake
soul
give
idleness
which
so
imperceptibly
swallowed
day
after
day
year
after
year
leaving
trace
think
out
himself
some
great
exploitfor
instance
walk
foot
far
far
away
or
give
meat
like
this
young
man
again
he
pictured
himself
time
when
animals
would
not
killed
pictured
it
clearly
distinctly
though
he
were
living
through
that
time
himself
but
suddenly
it
was
tangle
again
head
was
muddled
thunderstorm
passed
over
but
from
edges
storm
clouds
came
rain
softly
pattering
roof
zhmuhin
got
stretching
groaning
with
old
age
looked
into
parlour
noticing
that
visitor

colonel
there
who
was
vegetarian
too
he
didnt
eat
meat
never
went
shooting

that
every
animal
ought
live
freedom

its
life
only
i
dont
understand
how
pig
go
about
where
it
likes
without
being
looked
after
visitor
got
sat
down
pale
haggard
face
expressed
weariness
vexation
it
was
evident
that
he
was
exhausted
only
gentleness
delicacy
soul
prevented
him
from
expressing
vexation
words
its
getting
light
he
said
mildly
please

round
me
why
so
wait
little
rain

i
entreat

said
visitor
horror
with
supplicating
voice

he
began
hurriedly
dressing
by
time

racing
swiftly
by
patches
blue

timidly
reflected
below
big
puddles
visitor
walked
through
