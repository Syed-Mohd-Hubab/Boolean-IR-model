said
its
your

sheep
old
man
exerted
himself
utmost
but
left
leg
was
still
numb
digestion
was
getting
worse
worse
when

getting
poorer
poorer
he
made
mind
go

begin
dealing
corn

was
left
alone
days
flitted
by
one
after

without

without

former
churchwarden
an
honoured
respected
man
spent
whole
days
going
round
friends
shops
drinking
eating
listening
advice
mornings
evenings
while
away
time
he
went
church
looking
hours
together
ikons
he
did
not
pray
but
pondered
conscience
was
clear
he
ascribed
position
mistake
misunderstanding
mind
it
was
due
fact
that
officials
examining
magistrates
were
young
men
inexperienced
it
seemed
him
that
if
he
were
talk
it
over
detail
open
heart
some
elderly
judge
everything
would
go
right
again
he
did
not
understand
judges
he
fancied
they
did
not
understand
him
days
raced
by
last
after
protracted
harassing
delays
day
trial
came
avdeyev
borrowed
fifty
roubles
providing
himself
with
spirit
rub
leg
decoction
herbs
digestion
set
off
town
where
circuit
court
was
being
held
trial
lasted
ten
days
throughout
trial
avdeyev
sat
among
companions
misfortune
with
stolid
composure
dignity
befitting
respectable
innocent
man
who
suffering
fault
own
he
listened
did
not
understand
word
he
was
an
antagonistic
mood
he
was
angry
being
detained
so
long
court
being
unable
get
lenten
food
anywhere
defending
counsels
not
understanding
him
he
thought
saying
wrong
thing
he
thought
that
judges
did
not
understand
their
business
they
took
scarcely
any
notice
avdeyev
they
only
addressed
him
three
days
questions
they
put
him
were
such
character
that
avdeyev
raised
laugh
audience
each
time
he
answered
them
when
he
tried
speak
expenses
he
incurred
losses
meaning
claim
costs
from
court
counsel
turned
round
made
an
incomprehensible
grimace
public
laughed
judge
announced
sternly
that
that
nothing
with
case
last
words
that
he
was
allowed
say
were
not
what
counsel
instructed
him
say
but
something
quite
different
which
raised
laugh
again
during
terrible
hour
when
jury
were
consulting
their
room
he
sat
angrily
refreshment
bar
not
thinking
about
jury
he
did
not
understand
why
they
were
so
long
deliberating
when
everything
was
so
clear
what
they
wanted
him
getting
hungry
he
asked
waiter
give
him
some
cheap
lenten
dish
forty
kopecks
they
gave
him
some
cold
fish
carrots
he
ate
it
felt
though
fish
were
heaving
chilly
lump
stomach
it
was
followed
by
flatulence
heartburn
pain
afterwards
he
listened
foreman
jury
reading
out
questions
point
by
point
there
was
regular
revolution
taking
place
inside
whole
body
was
bathed
cold
sweat
left
leg
was
numb
he
did
not
follow
understood
nothing
suffered
unbearably
not
being
able
sit
or
lie
down
while
foreman
was
reading
last
when
he
companions
were
allowed
sit
down
public
prosecutor
got
said
something
unintelligible
though
they
sprung
out
earth
some
police
officers
appeared
scene
with
drawn
swords
surrounded
prisoners
avdeyev
was
told
get
go
now
he
understood
that
he
was
found
guilty
charge
police
but
he
was
not
frightened
nor
amazed
such
turmoil
was
going
stomach
that
he
could
not
think
about
guards
so
they
wont
let
us
go
back
hotel
he
asked
one
companions
but
i
three
roubles
an
untouched
quarter
pound
tea
my
room
there
he
spent
night
police
station
night
he
was
aware
loathing
fish
was
thinking
about
three
roubles
quarter
pound
tea
early
morning
when
sky
was
beginning
turn
blue
he
was
told
dress
set
off
two
soldiers
with
bayonets
took
him
prison
never
before
streets
town
seemed
him
so
long
endless
he
walked
not
pavement
but
middle
road
muddy
thawing
snow
inside
was
still
war
with
fish
left
leg
was
numb
he
forgotten
goloshes
either
court
or
police
station
feet
felt
frozen
five
days
later
prisoners
were
brought
before
court
again
hear
their
sentence
avdeyev
learnt
that
he
was
sentenced
exile
province
tobolsk
that
did
not
frighten
nor
amaze
him
either
he
fancied
some
reason
that
trial
was
not
yet
over
that
there
were
more
adjournments
come
that
final
decision
not
been
reached
yet
he
went
prison
expecting
this
final
decision
every
day
only
six
months
later
when
wife
son
vassily
came
say
good
bye
him
when
wasted
wretchedly
dressed
old
woman
he
scarcely
recognized
fat
dignified
elizaveta
trofimovna
when
he
saw
son
wearing
short
shabby
reefer
jacket
cotton
trousers
instead
high
school
uniform
he
realized
that
fate
was
decided
that
whatever
new
decision
there
might
past
would
never
come
back
him
first
time
since
trial
imprisonment
angry
expression
left
face
he
wept
bitterly
