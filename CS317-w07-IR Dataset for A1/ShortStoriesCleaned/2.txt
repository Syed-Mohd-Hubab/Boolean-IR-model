until
he
was
dismissed
owing

he
never
even

being
perfectly
healthy
he
always
been
pale
thin
given
catching
cold
he
ate
little
slept
badly
single
glass
wine
went
head
made
him
hysterical
he
always
craving
society
but
owing
irritable
temperament
suspiciousness
he
never
became
very
intimate
with
anyone
friends
he
always
spoke
with
contempt
fellow
townsmen
saying
that
their
coarse
ignorance
sleepy
animal
existence
seemed
him
loathsome
horrible
he
spoke
loud
tenor
with
heat
invariably
either
with
scorn
indignation
or
with
wonder
enthusiasm
always
with
perfect
sincerity
whatever
one
talked
him
about
he
always
brought
it
round
same
subject
that
life
was
dull
stifling
town
that
townspeople
lofty
interests
but
lived
dingy
meaningless
life
diversified
by
violence
coarse
profligacy
hypocrisy
that
scoundrels
were
well
fed
clothed
while
honest
men
lived
from
hand
mouth
that
they
needed
schools
progressive
local
paper
theatre
public
lectures
co
ordination
intellectual
elements
that
society
must
see
its
failings
horrified
criticisms
people
he
laid
colours
thick
using
only
black
white
fine
shades
mankind
was
divided
him
into
honest
men
scoundrels
there
was
nothing
between
he
always
spoke
with
passion
enthusiasm
women
love
but
he
never
been
love
spite
severity
judgments
nervousness
he
was
liked
behind
back
was
spoken
affectionately
vanya
innate
refinement
readiness
service
good
breeding
moral
purity
shabby
coat
frail
appearance
family
misfortunes
aroused
kind
warm
sorrowful
feeling
moreover
he
was
well
educated
well
read
according
townspeoples
notions
he
knew
everything
was
their
eyes
something
like
walking
encyclopedia
he
read
great
deal
he
would
sit
club
nervously
pulling
beard
looking
through
magazines
books
from
face
one
could
see
that
he
was
not
reading
but
devouring
pages
without
giving
himself
time
digest
what
he
read
it
must
supposed
that
reading
was
one
morbid
habits
he
fell
upon
anything
that
came
into
hands
with
equal
avidity
even
last
years
newspapers
calendars
home
he
always
read
lying
down
iii
one
autumn
morning
ivan
dmitritch
turning
collar
greatcoat
splashing
through
mud
made
way
by
side
streets
back
lanes
see
some
artisan
collect
some
payment
that
was
owing
he
was
gloomy
mood
he
always
was
morning
one
side
streets
he
was
met
by
two
convicts
fetters
four
soldiers
with
rifles
charge
them
ivan
dmitritch
very
often
met
convicts
before
they
always
excited
feelings
compassion
discomfort
him
but
now
this
meeting
made
peculiar
strange
impression
him
it
suddenly
seemed
him
some
reason
that
he
too
might
put
into
fetters
led
through
mud
prison
like
that
after
visiting
artisan
way
home
he
met
near
post
office
police
superintendent
acquaintance
who
greeted
him
walked
few
paces
along
street
with
him
some
reason
this
seemed
him
suspicious
home
he
could
not
get
convicts
or
soldiers
with
their
rifles
out
head
day
an
unaccountable
inward
agitation
prevented
him
from
reading
or
concentrating
mind
evening
he
did
not
light
lamp
night
he
could
not
sleep
but
kept
thinking
that
he
might
arrested
put
into
fetters
thrown
into
prison
he
did
not
know
any
harm
he
done
could
certain
that
he
would
never
guilty
murder
arson
or
theft
future
either
but
was
it
not
easy
commit
crime
by
accident
unconsciously
was
not
false
witness
always
possible
indeed
miscarriage
justice
it
was
not
without
good
reason
that
agelong
experience
simple
people
teaches
that
beggary
prison
ills
none
safe
from
judicial
mistake
very
possible
legal
proceedings
conducted
nowadays
there
nothing
wondered
it
people
who
an
official
professional
relation
other
mens
sufferings
instance
judges
police
officers
doctors
course
time
through
habit
grow
so
callous
that
they
cannot
even
if
they
wish
it
take
any
but
formal
attitude
their
clients
this
respect
they
not
different
from
peasant
who
slaughters
sheep
calves
back
yard
does
not
notice
blood
with
this
formal
soulless
attitude
human
personality
judge
needs
but
one
thing
time
order
deprive
an
innocent
man
rights
property
condemn
him
penal
servitude
only
time
spent
performing
certain
formalities
which
judge
paid
salary
then
it
over
then
you
may
look
vain
justice
protection
this
dirty
wretched
little
town
hundred
fifty
miles
from
railway
station
indeed
it
not
absurd
even
think
justice
when
every
kind
violence
accepted
by
society
rational
consistent
necessity
every
act
mercy
instance
verdict
acquittal
calls
forth
perfect
outburst
dissatisfied
revengeful
feeling
morning
ivan
dmitritch
got
from
bed
state
horror
with
cold
perspiration
forehead
completely
convinced
that
he
might
arrested
any
minute
since
gloomy
thoughts
yesterday
haunted
him
so
long
he
thought
it
must
that
there
was
some
truth
them
they
could
not
indeed
come
into
mind
without
any
grounds
whatever
policeman
walking
slowly
passed
by
windows
that
was
not
nothing
here
were
two
men
standing
still
silent
near
house
why
were
they
silent
agonizing
days
nights
followed
ivan
dmitritch
everyone
who
passed
by
windows
or
came
into
yard
seemed
him
spy
or
detective
midday
chief
police
usually
drove
down
street
with
pair
horses
he
was
going
from
estate
near
town
police
department
but
ivan
dmitritch
fancied
every
time
that
he
was
driving
especially
quickly
that
he
peculiar
expression
it
was
evident
that
he
was
haste
announce
that
there
was
very
important
criminal
town
ivan
dmitritch
started
every
ring
bell
knock
gate
was
agitated
whenever
he
came
upon
anyone
new
landladys
when
he
met
police
officers
gendarmes
he
smiled
began
whistling
so
seem
unconcerned
he
could
not
sleep
whole
nights
succession
expecting
arrested
but
he
snored
loudly
sighed
though
deep
sleep
that
landlady
might
think
he
was
asleep
if
he
could
not
sleep
it
meant
that
he
was
tormented
by
stings
conscience
what
piece
evidence
facts
common
sense
persuaded
him
that
these
terrors
were
nonsense
morbidity
that
if
one
looked
matter
more
broadly
there
was
nothing
really
terrible
arrest
imprisonment
so
long
conscience
ease
but
more
sensibly
logically
he
reasoned
more
acute
agonizing
mental
distress
became
it
might
compared
with

who
tried
cut
dwelling
place
himself
virgin

more
zealously
he
worked
with

thicker

grew
end
ivan
dmitritch
seeing
it
was
useless
gave
reasoning
altogether
abandoned
himself
entirely
despair
terror
he
began
avoid
people
seek
solitude
official
work
been
distasteful
him
before
now
it
became
unbearable
him
he
was
afraid
they
would
somehow
get
him
into
trouble
would
put
bribe
pocket
unnoticed
then
denounce
him
or
that
he
would
accidentally
make
mistake
official
papers
that
would
appear
fraudulent
or
would
lose
other
peoples
money
it
strange
that
imagination
never
other
times
been
so
agile
inventive
now
when
every
day
he
thought
thousands
different
reasons
being
seriously
anxious
over
freedom
honour
but
other
hand
interest
outer
world
books
particular
grew
sensibly
fainter
memory
began
fail
him
spring
when
snow
melted
there
were
found

near

two
half
decomposed
corpses
bodies
an
old
woman
boy
bearing
traces
death
by
violence
nothing
was
talked
but
these
bodies
their
unknown
murderers
that
people
might
not
think
he
been
guilty
crime
ivan
dmitritch
walked
about
streets
smiling
when
he
met
acquaintances
he
turned
pale
flushed
began
declaring
that
there
was
greater
crime
than
murder
weak
defenceless
but
this
duplicity
soon
exhausted
him
after
some
reflection
he
decided
that
position
best
thing
was
hide
landladys

he
sat
cellar
day
then
night
then
another
day
was
fearfully
cold
waiting
till

stole
secretly
like

he
stood
middle

till
daybreak
listening
without
stirring
very
early
morning
before

some
workmen
came
into

ivan
dmitritch
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
come
mend

but
terror
told
him
that
they
were
police
officers
disguised

he
slipped
stealthily
out

overcome
by
terror
ran
along

without

raced
after

it
seemed
ivan

that

pleasant
idea
mind
some
very
important
agreeable
secret
he
under
pillow
under
mattress
something
that
he
never
shows
anyone
not
from
fear
its
being
taken
from
him
stolen
but
from
modesty
sometimes
he
goes
window
turning
back
companions
puts
something
breast
bending
head
looks
it
if
you
go
him
such
moment
he
overcome
with
confusion
snatches
something
off
breast
but
it
not
difficult
guess
secret
congratulate
me
he
often
says
ivan

presented
with

but
some
reason
they
want
make
an
exception
me
he
says
with
smile
shrugging
shoulders
perplexity
that
i
must
confess
i
did
not
expect
i
dont
understand
anything
about
that
ivan
dmitritch
replies
morosely
but
you
know
what
i
shall
attain
sooner
or
later
former
sorter
persists
screwing
eyes
slyly
i
shall
certainly
get
swedish
polar

thats
an
order
it
worth
working
white
cross
with
black
ribbon
its
very
beautiful
probably
other
place
life
so
monotonous
this
ward
morning
patients
except
paralytic
fat
peasant
wash

big

wipe
themselves
with
skirts
their
dressing
gowns
after
that
they
drink
tea
out
tin

which
nikita
brings

out

everyone

they

how

him
it
what
trepidation
lunatics
always

drunken

not
describe

even

but
nikita
rather
strange
rumour
however
been
circulating
hospital
late
it
rumoured
that
doctor
begun
visit
ward
v
strange
rumour
dr
andrey
yefimitch
ragin
strange
man
way
they
say
that
when
he
was
young
he
was
very
religious
prepared
himself
clerical
career
that
when
he
finished
studies
high
school
he
intended
enter
theological
academy
but
that
father
surgeon
doctor
medicine
jeered
him
declared
point
blank
that
he
would
disown
him
if
he
became
priest
how
far
this
true
i
dont
know
but
andrey
yefimitch
himself
more
than
confessed
that
he
never
natural
bent
medicine
or
science
general
however
that
may
been
when
he
finished
studies
medical
faculty
he
did
not
enter
priesthood
he
showed
special
devoutness
was
more
like
priest
beginning
medical
career
than
he
now
exterior
heavy
coarse
like
peasants
face
beard
flat
hair
coarse
clumsy
figure
suggest
an
overfed
intemperate
harsh
innkeeper
highroad
face
surly
looking
covered
with
blue
veins
eyes
little
nose
red
with
height
broad
shoulders
he
huge
hands
feet
one
would
think
that
blow
from
fist
would
knock
life
out
anyone
but
step
soft
walk
cautious
insinuating
when
he
meets
anyone
narrow
passage
he
always
first
stop
make
way
say
not
bass
one
would
expect
but
high
soft
tenor
i
beg
your
pardon
he
little
swelling
neck
which
prevents
him
from
wearing
stiff
starched
collars
so
he
always
goes
about
soft
linen
or
cotton
shirts
altogether
he
does
not
dress
like
doctor
he
wears
same
suit
ten
years
new
clothes
which
he
usually
buys
jewish
shop
look
shabby
crumpled
him
old
ones
he
sees
patients
dines
pays
visits
same
coat
but
this
not
due
niggardliness
but
complete
carelessness
about
appearance
when
andrey
yefimitch
came
town
take
duties
institution
founded
glory
god
was
terrible
condition
one
could
hardly
breathe
stench
wards
passages
courtyards
hospital
hospital
servants
nurses
their
children
slept
wards
together
with
patients
they
complained
that
there
was
living
beetles
bugs
mice
surgical
wards
were
never
free
from
erysipelas
there
were
only
two
scalpels
not
one
thermometer
whole
hospital
potatoes
were
kept
baths
superintendent
housekeeper
medical
assistant
robbed
patients
old
doctor
andrey
yefimitchs
predecessor
people
declared
that
he
secretly
sold
hospital
alcohol
that
he
kept
regular
harem
consisting
nurses
female
patients
these
disorderly
proceedings
were
perfectly
well
known
town
were
even
exaggerated
but
people
took
them
calmly
some
justified
them
ground
that
there
were
only
peasants
working
men
hospital
who
could
not
dissatisfied
since
they
were
much
worse
off
home
than
hospital
they
couldnt
fed
woodcocks
others
said
excuse
that
town
alone
without
help
from
zemstvo
was
not
equal
maintaining
good
hospital
thank
god
having
one
even
poor
one
newly
formed
zemstvo
did
not
open
infirmaries
either
town
or
neighbourhood
relying
fact
that
town
already
its
hospital
after
looking
over
hospital
andrey
yefimitch
came
conclusion
that
it
was
an
immoral
institution
extremely
prejudicial
health
townspeople
opinion
most
sensible
thing
that
could
done
was
let
out
patients
close
hospital
but
he
reflected
that
will
alone
was
not
enough
this
that
it
would
useless
if
physical
moral
impurity
were
driven
out
one
place
they
would
only
move
another
one
must
wait
it
wither
away
itself
besides
if
people
open
hospital
put
with
having
it
it
must
because
they
need
it
superstition
nastiness
abominations
daily
life
were
necessary
since
process
time
they
worked
out
something
sensible
just
manure
turns
into
black
earth
there
was
nothing
earth
so
good
that
it
not
something
nasty
about
its
first
origin
when
andrey
yefimitch
undertook
duties
he
was
apparently
not
greatly
concerned
about
irregularities
hospital
he
only
asked
attendants
nurses
not
sleep
wards
two
cupboards
instruments
put
superintendent
housekeeper
medical
assistant
erysipelas
remained
unchanged
andrey
yefimitch
loved
intelligence
honesty
intensely
but
he
strength
will
nor
belief
right
organize
an
intelligent
honest
life
about
him
he
was
absolutely
unable
give
orders
forbid
things
insist
it
seemed
though
he
taken
vow
never
raise
voice
never
make
use
imperative
it
was
difficult
him
say
fetch
or
bring
when
he
wanted
meals
he
would
cough
hesitatingly
say
cook
how
about
tea
or
how
about
dinner
dismiss
superintendent
or
tell
him
leave
off
stealing
or
abolish
unnecessary
parasitic
post
altogether
was
absolutely
beyond
powers
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
deceived
or
flattered
or
accounts
he
knew
cooked
were
brought
him
sign
he
would
turn
red
crab
feel
guilty
but
yet
he
would
sign
accounts
when
patients
complained
him
being
hungry
or
roughness
nurses
he
would
confused
mutter
guiltily
very
well
very
well
i
will
go
into
it
later
most
likely
there
some
misunderstanding
first
andrey
yefimitch
worked
very
zealously
he
saw
patients
every
day
from
morning
till
dinner
time
performed
operations
even
attended
confinements
ladies
said
him
that
he
was
attentive
clever
diagnosing
diseases
especially
those
women
children
but
process
time
work
unmistakably
wearied
him
by
its
monotony
obvious
uselessness
day
one
sees
thirty
patients
morrow
they
increased
thirty
five
next
day
forty
so
from
day
day
from
year
year
while
mortality
town
did
not
decrease
patients
did
not
leave
off
coming
any
real
help
forty
patients
between
morning
dinner
was
not
physically
possible
so
it
could
but
lead
deception
if
twelve
thousand
patients
were
seen
year
it
meant
if
one
looked
it
simply
that
twelve
thousand
men
were
deceived
put
those
who
were
seriously
ill
into
wards
treat
them
according
principles
science
was
impossible
too
because
though
there
were
principles
there
was
science
if
he
were
put
aside
philosophy
pedantically
follow
rules
other
doctors
did
things
above
necessary
were
cleanliness
ventilation
instead
dirt
wholesome
nourishment
instead
broth
made
stinking
sour
cabbage
good
assistants
instead
thieves
indeed
why
hinder
people
dying
if
death
normal
legitimate
end
everyone
what
gained
if
some
shop
keeper
or
clerk
lives
an
extra
five
or
ten
years
if
aim
medicine
by
drugs
alleviate
suffering
question
forces
itself
one
why
alleviate
it
first
place
they
say
that
suffering
leads
man
perfection
second
if
mankind
really
learns
alleviate
its
sufferings
with
pills
drops
it
will
completely
abandon
religion
philosophy
which
it
hitherto
found
not
merely
protection
from
sorts
trouble
but
even
happiness
pushkin
suffered
terrible
agonies
before
death
poor
heine
lay
paralyzed
several
years
why
then
should
not
some
andrey
yefimitch
or
matryona
savishna
ill
since
their
lives
nothing
importance
them
would
been
entirely
empty
like

an
amoeba
except
suffering
oppressed
by
such
reflections
andrey
yefimitch
relaxed
efforts
gave
visiting
hospital
every
day
vi

was
passed
like
this
rule
he

was
confined
asking

andrey

andrey
yefimitch
sat
down

took

always
with

was

which
he
always
read

without

without
being

he
did

slowly
with

often
pausing
over

which
he
liked

there
always
stood
decanter

not

every
half
hour
he
would
pour
himself
out

drink
it
without
taking

off

then
without
looking

he
would
feel

bite

three
oclock

would
go
cautiously

cough
say
daryushka
what
about
dinner
after

rather
poor
untidily
served
one
andrey
yefimitch
would

with

daryushka

whose

been
very
rich

served

take

late

he
hale
hearty
appearance
luxuriant
grey

well

loud
pleasant

he
was
good
natured
emotional
but
hot
tempered
when
anyone
post
office
made
protest
expressed
disagreement
or
even
began
argue
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
shake
over
shout

thunder
hold
your
tongue
so
that
post
office
long
enjoyed
reputation
an
institution
which
it
was
terrible

mihail

liked
respected
andrey
yefimitch

he
treated
other

superciliously
though
they
were

here
i
he
would
say
going
andrey
yefimitch
good
evening
my
dear
fellow
ill
bound
you
getting
sick
me
arent
you
contrary
i
delighted
said

i
always
glad
see
you

would
sit

some
time
would
smoke

daryushka
what
about

brooding
mihail
averyanitch
with
gay
animated

like

who
something
very
interesting

was
always
one
begin

what
pity
he
would
say
quietly
slowly
not
looking

face
he
never
looked
anyone
face
what
great
pity
it
that
there
people
our
town
who
capable
carrying
intelligent
interesting
conversation
or
care
so
it
an
immense
privation
us
even
educated
class
not
rise
above
vulgarity
level
their
development
i
assure
you
not
bit
higher
than
that
lower
orders
perfectly
true
i
agree
you
know
course
doctor
went
quietly
deliberately
that
everything
this
world
insignificant
uninteresting
except
higher
spiritual
manifestations
human
mind
intellect
draws
sharp
line
between
animals
man
suggests
divinity
latter
some
extent
even
takes
place
immortality
which
does
not
exist
consequently
intellect
only
possible
source
enjoyment
see
hear
trace
intellect
about
us
so
deprived
enjoyment
books
it
true
but
that
not
same
living
talk
converse
if
you
will
allow
me
make
not
quite
apt
comparison
books
printed
score
while
talk
singing
perfectly
true
silence
would
follow
daryushka
would
come
out
kitchen
with
an
expression
blank
dejection
would
stand
doorway
listen
with
face
propped
fist
eh
mihail
averyanitch
would
sigh
expect
intelligence
this
generation
he
would
describe
how
wholesome
entertaining
interesting
life
been
past
how
intelligent
educated
class
russia
used
what
lofty
ideas
it
honour
friendship
how
they
used
lend
money
without
an
iou
it
was
thought
disgrace
not
give
helping
hand
comrade
need
what
campaigns
what
adventures
what
skirmishes
what
comrades
what
women
caucasus
what
marvellous
country
wife
battalion
commander
queer
woman
used
put
an
officers
uniform
drive
off
into

evening
alone
without

it
was
said
that
she
love
affair
with
some
princeling
native
village
queen
heaven
holy
mother
daryushka
would
sigh
how
drank
how
ate
what
desperate
liberals
were
andrey
yefimitch
would
listen
without
hearing
he
was
musing
he
sipped
beer
i
often
dream
intellectual
people
conversation
with
them
he
said
suddenly
interrupting
mihail
averyanitch
my
father
gave
me
an
excellent
education
but
under
influence
ideas
sixties
made
me
become
doctor
i
believe
if
i
not
obeyed
him
then
by
now
i
should
been
very
centre
intellectual
movement
most
likely
i
should
become
member
some
university
course
intellect
too
transient
not
eternal
but
you
know
why
i
cherish
partiality
it
life
vexatious
trap
when
thinking
man
reaches
maturity
attains
full
consciousness
he
cannot
help
feeling
that
he
trap
from
which
there
escape
indeed
he
summoned
without
choice
by
fortuitous
circumstances
from
non
existence
into
life
what
he
tries
find
out
meaning
object
existence
he
told
nothing
or
he
told
absurdities
he
knocks
it
not
opened
him
death
comes
him
also
without
choice
so
just
prison
men
held
together
by
common
misfortune
feel
more
ease
when
they
together
so
one
does
not
notice
trap
life
when
people
with
bent
analysis
generalization
meet
together
pass
their
time
interchange
proud
free
ideas
that
sense
intellect
source
an
enjoyment
nothing
replace
perfectly
true
not
looking
friend
face
andrey
yefimitch
would
go
quietly
with
pauses
talking

after

evening
afterwards
night
was
not
broken
by
single
sound
it
seemed
though
time
were
standing
still
brooding
with

there
were
nothing

but
books

was
gradually
lighted
by
smile

over

oh
why
not

he
thought
what
good
brain
centres
convolutions
what
good
sight

self
consciousness
genius
if
it
destined
depart
into

end
grow
cold
together
with

then
millions
years
fly
with

round

with

object
that
there
was
need
draw
man
with
lofty
almost
godlike
intellect
out
non
existence
then
though
mockery
turn
him
into
clay
transmutation

but
what
cowardice
comfort
oneself
with
that
cheap
substitute
immortality
unconscious
processes
that
take
place
nature
lower
even
than
stupidity
man
since
stupidity
there
anyway

will
while
those

there
absolutely
nothing
only
coward
who
more
fear

when

struck
andrey
yefimitch
would
sink
back
into
chair
close
eyes
think
little
under
influence
fine
ideas
which
he
been
reading
he
would
unawares
recall
past
present
past
was
hateful
better
not
think
it
it
was

he
knew
that
very
time
when
thoughts
were
floating
together
with
cooling
earth
round
sun
main
building
beside

people
were
suffering
sickness
physical
impurity
someone
perhaps
could
not
sleep
was
making
war
upon
insects
someone
was
being
infected
by
erysipelas
or
moaning
over
too
tight
bandage
perhaps
patients
were
playing

with

whole

done
twenty
years

before
it
was
an

extremely
injurious

inhabitants
he
knew
that
nikita
knocked
patients
about
behind
barred

ward
that
moiseika
went
about
town
every
day
begging

other

he
knew
very
well
that
magical
change
taken
place
medicine
during
last
twenty
five
years
when
he
was
studying
university
he
fancied
that
medicine
would
soon
overtaken
by
fate
alchemy
metaphysics
but
now
when
he
was
reading
night
science
medicine
touched
him
excited
wonder
even
enthusiasm
what
unexpected
brilliance
what
revolution
thanks
antiseptic

were
performed
such
great

considered
impossible
even
spe
ordinary

were
venturing

with

was
perfect
elborus
comparison
with
what
been
past
they
longer
poured
cold
water
heads
lunatics
nor
put
strait
waistcoats
upon
them
they
treated
them
with
humanity
even
so
it
was
stated
papers
got
balls

them
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
with
modern
tastes
views
such
an
abomination
ward
was
possible
only
hundred
fifty
miles
from
railway
little
town
where
mayor
town
council
were
half
illiterate
tradesmen
who
looked
upon
doctor
an
oracle
who
must
believed
without
any
criticism
even
if
he
poured
molten
lead
into
their
mouths
any
other
place
public
newspapers
would
long
ago
torn
this
little

pieces
but
after
what
it
andrey
yefimitch
would
ask
himself
opening

there
antiseptic

but
essential
reality
not
altered
bit
ill
health

still
same
they
get

mad
but
still
they
dont
let
them
go

its
nonsense
vanity
there
difference

between

prevented
him
from

put

he
sat
down

nikita
did
not
venture
search
presence
doctor
laid
out
bed
pieces
bread
bits
paper
little
bones
still
shivering
with
cold
began
rapidly
singsong
voice
saying
something
yiddish
he
most
likely
imagined
that
he
opened
shop
let
me
out
said
ivan
dmitritch
voice
quivered
i
cannot
but
why
why
because
it
not

you
or
bring
you
back

dmitritchs
voice
intelligent
young
face
with
its
grimaces
he
longed
kind
young
man
soothe
him
he
sat
down

beside
him
thought
said
you
ask
me
what
very
best
thing
your
position
would
run
away
but
unhappily
that
useless
you
would
taken
when
society
protects
itself
from
criminal
mentally
deranged
or
otherwise
inconvenient
people
it
invincible
there
only
one
thing
left
you
resign
yourself
thought
that
your
presence
here
inevitable
it
use
anyone
so
long
prisons
madhouses
exist
someone
must
shut
them
if
not
you
i
if
not
i
some
third
person
wait
till
distant
future
prisons
madhouses
longer
exist
there
will
neither
bars
windows
nor
hospital
gowns
course
that
time
will
come
sooner
or
later
ivan
dmitritch
smiled
ironically
you
jesting
he
said
screwing
eyes
such
gentlemen
you
your
assistant
nikita

triumph
our
turn
will
come
i
shall
not
live
see
it
i
shall
perish

some
peoples

i
greet
them
with
my
heart
rejoice
rejoice
with
them
onward
god
your
help

ivan
dmitritch
got
stretching

towards

with
emotion
voice
from
behind
these
bars
i
bless
you
hurrah
truth

said
andrey
yefimitch
who
thought
ivan
dmitritchs
movement
theatrical
though
he
was
delighted
by
it
prisons
madhouses
there
will
not
truth
you
just
expressed
it
will
triumph
but
reality
things
you
know
will
not
change
laws
nature
will
still
remain
same
people
will
suffer
pain
grow
old
die
just
they
now
however
magnificent
dawn
lighted
your
life
you
would
yet
end
nailed
coffin
thrown
into

immortality
oh
come
now
you
dont
believe
it
but
i
somebody
dostoevsky
or
voltaire
said
that
if
there
not
been
god
men
would
invented
him
i
firmly
believe
that
if
there
immortality
great
intellect
man
will
sooner
or
later
invent
it
well
said
observed
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
with
pleasure
its
good
thing
you
faith
with
such
belief
one
may
live
happily
even
shut
within
walls
you
studied
somewhere
i
presume
yes
i
been
university
but
did
not
complete
my
studies
you
reflecting
thoughtful
man
any
surroundings
you
find
tranquillity
yourself
free
deep
thinking
which
strives
comprehension
life
complete
contempt
foolish
bustle
world
those
two
blessings
beyond
any
that
man
ever
known
you
possess
them
even
though
you
lived
behind
threefold
bars
diogenes
lived
tub
yet
he
was
happier
than
kings
earth
your
diogenes
was
blockhead
said
ivan
dmitritch
morosely
why
you
talk
me
about
diogenes
some
foolish
comprehension
life
he
cried
growing
suddenly
angry
leaping
i
love
life
i
love
it
passionately
i
mania
persecution
continual
agonizing
terror
but
i
moments
when
i
overwhelmed
by
thirst
life
then
i
afraid
going
mad
i
want
dreadfully
live
dreadfully
he
walked
down
ward
agitation
said
dropping
voice
when
i
dream
i
haunted
by
phantoms
people
come

i
hear
voices
music
i
fancy

time
well

every
sign

intellectual
stagnation
our
capital
cities

so
there

some
reason

men

would
rather

unlucky
town

unlucky
town
sighed
ivan
dmitritch
he
laughed
how
things
general
what
they
writing
papers
reviews
it
was
by
now
dark
ward
doctor
got
standing
began
describe
what
was
being
written
abroad
russia
tendency
thought
that
could
noticed
now
ivan
dmitritch
listened
attentively
put
questions
but
suddenly
though
recalling
something
terrible
clutched
head
lay
down
bed
with
back
doctor
whats
matter
asked
andrey
yefimitch
you
will
not
hear
another
word
from
me
said
ivan
dmitritch
rudely
leave
me
alone
why
so
i
tell
you
leave
me
alone
why
devil
you
persist
andrey
yefimitch
shrugged
shoulders
heaved
sigh
went
out
he
crossed
entry
he
said
you
might
clear
here
nikita
theres
an
awfully
stuffy
smell
certainly
your
honour
what
an
agreeable
young
man
thought
andrey
yefimitch
going
back
flat
years
i
been
living
here
i
believe
he
first
i
met
with
whom
one
talk
he
capable
reasoning
interested
just
right
things
while
he
was
reading
afterwards
while
he
was
going
bed
he
kept
thinking
about
ivan
dmitritch
when
he
woke
next
morning
he
remembered
that
he
day
before
made
acquaintance
an
intelligent
interesting
man
determined
visit
him
again
soon
possible
x
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
same
position
previous
day
with
head
clutched
both
hands
legs
drawn
face
was
not
visible
good
day
my
friend
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
not
asleep
you
first
place
i
not
your
friend
ivan
dmitritch
articulated
into
pillow
second
your
efforts
useless
you
will
not
get
one
word
out
me
strange
muttered
andrey
yefimitch
confusion
yesterday
talked
peacefully
but
suddenly
some
reason
you
took
offence
broke
off
probably
i
expressed
myself
awkwardly
or
perhaps
gave
utterance
some
idea
which
did
not
fit
with
your
convictions
yes
likely
idea
said
ivan
dmitritch
sitting
looking
doctor
with
irony
uneasiness
eyes
were
red
you
go
spy
probe
somewhere
else
its
use
your
doing
it
here
i
knew
yesterday
what
you
come
strange
fancy
laughed
doctor
so
you
suppose
me
spy
yes
i
spy
or
doctor
who
been
charged
test
me
its
same
oh
excuse
me
what
queer
fellow
you
really
doctor
sat
down
stool
near
bed
shook
head
reproachfully
but
let
us
suppose
you
right
he
said
let
us
suppose
that
i
treacherously
trying
trap
you
into
saying
something
so
betray
you
police
you
would
arrested
then
tried
but
would
you
any
worse
off
being
tried
prison
than
you
here
if
you
banished
settlement
or
even
sent
penal
servitude
would
it
worse
than
being
shut
this
ward
i
imagine
it
would
worse
what
then
you
afraid
these
words
evidently
an
effect
ivan
dmitritch
he
sat
down
quietly
it
was
between
four
five
afternoon
time
when
andrey
yefimitch
usually
walked
down
rooms

since
i
lived
like
human
being
its
disgusting
here
insufferably
disgusting
after
excitement
previous
day
he
was
exhausted
listless
spoke
unwillingly
fingers
twitched
from
face
it
could
seen
that
he
splitting
headache
there
real
difference
between
warm
snug
study
this
ward
said
andrey
yefimitch
mans
peace
contentment
not
lie
outside
man
but
himself
what
you
mean
ordinary
man
looks
good
evil
external
things
that
carriages
studies
but
thinking
man
looks
it
himself
you
should
go
preach
that
philosophy
greece
where
its
warm
fragrant
with
scent
pomegranates
but
here
it
not
suited
climate
with
whom
was
it
i
was
talking
diogenes
was
it
with
you
yes
with
me
yesterday
diogenes
did
not
need
study
or
warm
habitation
its
hot
there
without
you
lie
your
tub
eat
oranges
olives
but
bring
him
russia
live
hed
begging
let
indoors
may
let
alone
december
hed
doubled
with
cold
one
insensible
cold
every
other
pain
marcus
aurelius
says
pain
vivid
idea
pain
make
an
effort
will
change
that
idea
dismiss
it
cease
complain
pain
will
disappear
that
true
wise
man
or
simply
reflecting
thoughtful
man
distinguished
precisely
by
contempt
suffering
he
always
contented
surprised
nothing
then
i
an
idiot
since
i
suffer
discontented
surprised
baseness
mankind
you
wrong
that
if
you
will
reflect
more
subject
you
will
understand
how
insignificant
that
external
world
that
agitates
us
one
must
strive
comprehension
life
that
true
happiness
comprehension
repeated
ivan
dmitritch
frowning
external
internal
excuse
me
but
i
dont
understand
it
i
only
know
he
said
getting
looking
angrily
doctor
i
only
know
that
god
created
me
warm
blood
nerves
yes
indeed
if
organic
tissue
capable
life
it
must
react
every
stimulus
i
pain
i
respond
with
tears
outcries
baseness
with
indignation
filth
with
loathing
my
mind
that
just
what
called
life
lower
organism
less
sensitive
it
more
feebly
it
reacts
stimulus
higher
it
more
responsively
vigorously
it
reacts
reality
how
it
you
dont
know
that
doctor
not
know
such
trifles
despise
suffering
always
contented
surprised
nothing
one
must
reach
this
condition
ivan
dmitritch
pointed
peasant
who
was
mass
fat
or
harden
oneself
by
suffering
such
point
that
one
loses
sensibility
it
that
other
words
cease
live
you
must
excuse
me
i
not
sage
or
philosopher
ivan
dmitritch
continued
with
irritation
i
dont
understand
anything
about
it
i
not
capable
reasoning
contrary
your
reasoning
excellent
stoics
whom
you
parodying
were
remarkable
people
but
their
doctrine
crystallized
two
thousand
years
ago
not
advanced
will
not
advance
an
inch
forward
since
it
not
practical
or
living
it
success
only
with
minority
which
spends
its
life
savouring
sorts
theories
ruminating
over
them
majority
did
not
understand
it
doctrine
which
advocates
indifference
wealth
comforts
life
contempt
suffering
death
quite
unintelligible
vast
majority
men
since
that
majority
never
known
wealth
or
comforts
life
despise
suffering
would
mean
it
despising
life
itself
since
whole
existence
man
made
sensations
hunger
cold
injury
hamlet
like
dread
death
whole
life
lies
these
sensations
one
may
oppressed
by
it
one
may
hate
it
but
one
cannot
despise
it
yes
so
i
repeat
doctrine
stoics
never
future
from
beginning
time
day
you
see
continually
increasing
struggle
sensibility
pain
capacity
responding
stimulus
ivan
dmitritch
suddenly
lost
thread
thoughts
stopped
rubbed
forehead
with
vexation
i
meant
say
something
important
but
i
lost
it
he
said
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
this
what
i
mean
one
stoics
sold
himself
into
slavery
redeem
neighbour
so
you
see
even
stoic
did
react
stimulus
since
such
generous
act
destruction
oneself
sake
ones
neighbour
he
must
soul
capable
pity
indignation
here
prison
i
forgotten
everything
i
learned
or
else
i
could
recalled
something
else
take
christ
instance
christ
responded
reality
by
weeping
smiling
being
sorrowful
moved
wrath
even
overcome
by
misery
he
did
not
go
meet
sufferings
with
smile
he
did
not
despise
death
but
prayed
garden
gethsemane
that
this
cup
might
pass
him
by
ivan
dmitritch
laughed
sat
down
granted
that
mans
peace
contentment
lie
not
outside
but
himself
he
said
granted
that
one
must
despise
suffering
not
surprised
anything
yet
what
ground
you
preach
theory
you
sage
philosopher
i
not
philosopher
but
everyone
ought
preach
it
because
it
reasonable
i
want
know
how
it
that
you
consider
yourself
competent
judge
comprehension
contempt
suffering
so
you
ever
suffered
you
any
idea
suffering
allow
me
ask
you
were
you
ever
thrashed
your
childhood
my
parents
an
aversion
corporal
punishment
my
father
used
flog
me
cruelly
my
father
was
harsh
sickly
government
clerk
with
long
nose
yellow
neck
but
let
us
talk
you
one
laid
finger
you
your
life
one
scared
you
nor
beaten
you
you
strong
bull
you
grew
under
your
fathers
wing
studied
expense
then
you
dropped
into
sinecure
more
than
twenty
years
you
lived
rent
free
with
heating
lighting
service
provided
right
work
how
you
pleased
much
you
pleased
even
nothing
you
were
naturally
flabby
lazy
man
so
you
tried
arrange
your
life
so
that
nothing
should
disturb
you
or
make
you
move
you
handed
over
your
work
assistant
rest
rabble
while
you
sit
peace
warmth
save
money
read
amuse
yourself
with
reflections
with
sorts
lofty
nonsense
ivan
dmitritch
looked
doctors
red
nose
with
boozing
fact
you
seen
nothing
life
you
know
absolutely
nothing
it
only
theoretically
acquainted
with
reality
you
despise
suffering
surprised
nothing
very
simple
reason
vanity
vanities
external
internal
contempt
life
suffering
death
comprehension
true
happiness
thats
philosophy
that
suits
russian
sluggard
best
you
see
peasant
beating
wife
instance
why
interfere
let
him
beat
they
will
both
die
sooner
or
later
anyway
besides
he
who
beats
injures
by
blows
not
person
he
beating
but
himself
get
drunk
stupid
unseemly
but
if
you
drink
you
die
if
you
dont
drink
you
die
peasant
woman
comes
with
toothache
well
what
it
pain
idea
pain
besides
there
living
this
world
without
illness
shall
die
so
go
away
woman
dont
hinder
me
from
thinking
drinking
vodka
young
man
asks
advice
what
he
how
he
live
anyone
else
would
think
before
answering
but
you
got
answer
ready
strive
comprehension
or
true
happiness
what
that
fantastic
true
happiness
theres
answer
course
kept
here
behind
barred
windows
tortured
left
rot
but
that
very
good
reasonable
because
there
difference
between
this
ward
warm
snug
study
convenient
philosophy
you
nothing
your
conscience
clear
you
feel
you
wise
sir
it
not
philosophy
its
not
thinking
its
not
breadth
vision
but
laziness
fakirism
drowsy
stupefaction
yes
cried
ivan
dmitritch
getting
angry
again
you
despise
suffering
but
ill
bound
if
you
pinch
your
finger
door
you
will
howl
top
your
voice
perhaps
i
shouldnt
howl
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
gentle
smile
oh
i
dare
say
well
if
you
stroke
paralysis
or
supposing
some
fool
or
bully
took
advantage
position
rank
insult
you
public
if
you
knew
he
could
it
with
impunity
then
you
would
understand
what
it
means
put
people
off
with
comprehension
true
happiness
thats
original
said
andrey
yefimitch
laughing
with
pleasure
rubbing
hands
i
agreeably
struck
by
your
inclination
drawing
generalizations
sketch
my
character
you
just
drawn
simply
brilliant
i
must
confess
that
talking
you
gives
me
great
pleasure
well
ive
listened
you
now
you
must
graciously
listen
me
xi
conversation
went
about
an
hour
longer
apparently
made
deep
impression
andrey
yefimitch
he
began
going
ward
every
day
he
went
there
mornings
after
dinner
often
dusk
evening
found
him
conversation
with
ivan
dmitritch
first
ivan
dmitritch
held
aloof
from
him
suspected
him
evil
designs
openly
expressed
hostility
but
afterwards
he
got
used
him
abrupt
manner
changed
one
condescending
irony
soon
it
was
over
hospital
that
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
taken
visiting
ward
one
neither
sergey
sergevitch
nor
nikita
nor
nurses
could
conceive
why
he
went
there
why
he
stayed
there
hours
together
what
he
was
talking
about
why
he
did
not
write
prescriptions
actions
seemed
strange
often
mihail
averyanitch
did
not
find
him
home
which
never
happened
past
daryushka
was
greatly
perturbed
doctor
drank
beer

hobotov
heard
following
conversation

your
faith
ivan
dmitritch
was
saying
irritably
you
utterly
ignorant

only
like
leech

others
while

said
andrey
yefimitch
gently
with
regret
that

him
that
not
what

my
friend

not
that
you

i
not
joy

that
common
bond
between
us
however
different
our

universal
senselessness
ineptitude
stupidity
with
what
delight
i
always
talk

hobotov

yevgeny

inquisitively

whispered
together
superintendents

now
when

longer
said
perfectly
true
he
listened
him
but
unaccountable
confusion
muttered

looked
him
with
grieved
thoughtful
expression
some
reason
he
took
advising
friend
give
vodka
beer
but
man
delicate
feeling
he
did
not

this
directly
but
hinted
it

then
about

fellow
both

two
or
three
occasions
andrey

was
visited
by

you
ten
years
ago

without

describing

what

he
what
meetings
he
talked
loudly
opened
eyes
so
wide
with
wonder
that

saying
loudly
that

he
thought
with
vexation
i

he
while

feeling
annoyance
with
mihail

he
longed

from

get
away
from

hide
himself
while

thought
it
was
duty
not
let
doctor
move
step
away
from

provide
him
with
many
distractions
possible
when
there
was
nothing

he
entertained
him
with

two
days
andrey
yefimitch
endured
it
but
third
he
announced

that
he
was
ill
wanted
stay

whole

friend
replied
that
that
case
he
would
stay
too
that
really
he
needed
rest
he
was
run
off
legs
already
andrey
yefimitch
lay

with
face
back
clenching
teeth
listened
friend
who
assured
him
with
heat
that
sooner
or
later
france
would
certainly
thrash
germany
that
there
were
great
many
scoundrels
moscow
that
it
was
impossible
judge
horses
quality
by
its
outward
appearance
doctor
began
buzzing
ears
palpitations
heart
but
out
delicacy
could
not
bring
himself
beg
friend
go
away
or
hold
tongue
fortunately
mihail
averyanitch
grew
weary
sitting
hotel
room
after
dinner
he
went
out
walk
soon
he
was
alone
andrey
yefimitch
abandoned
himself
feeling
relief
how
pleasant
lie
motionless

know
that
one
alone

real
happiness
impossible
without
solitude
fallen
angel
betrayed
god
probably
because
he
longed
solitude
which
angels
know
nothing
andrey
yefimitch
wanted
think
about
what
he
seen
heard
during
last
few
days
but
he
could
not
get
mihail
averyanitch
out
head
why
he
taken
holiday
come
with
me
out
friendship
out
generosity
thought
doctor
with
vexation
nothing
could
worse
than
this
friendly
supervision
i
suppose
he
good
natured
generous
lively
fellow
but
he
bore
an
insufferable
bore
same
way
there
people
who
never
say
anything
but
what
clever
good
yet
one
feels
that
they
dull
witted
people
following
days
andrey
yefimitch
declared
himself
ill
would
not
leave
hotel
room
he
lay
with
face
back
sofa
suffered
agonies
weariness
when
friend
entertained
him
with
conversation
or
rested
when
friend
was
absent
he
was
vexed
with
himself
having
come
with
friend
who
grew
every
day
more
talkative
more
free
easy
he
could
not
succeed
attuning
thoughts
serious
lofty
level
this
what
i
get
from
real
life
ivan
dmitritch
talked
about
he
thought
angry
own
pettiness
its
consequence
though
i
shall
go
home
everything
will
go
before
it
was
same
thing
petersburg
too
whole
days
together
he
did
not

insist
own

much
against

went
warsaw
there
he
did
not
leave
hotel
room
but
lay
sofa
furious
with
himself
with
friend
with
waiters
who
obstinately
refused
understand
russian
while
mihail
averyanitch
healthy
hearty
full
spirits
usual
went
about
town
from
morning
night
looking
old
acquaintances
several
times
he
did
not
return
home
night
after
one
night
spent
some
unknown
haunt
he
returned
home
early
morning
violently
excited
condition
with
red
face
tousled
hair
long
time
he
walked
down
rooms
muttering
something
himself
then
stopped
said
honour
before
everything
after
walking
down
little
longer
he
clutched
head
both
hands
pronounced
tragic
voice
yes

before
everything
accursed
moment
when
idea
first
entered

head

added
addressing

yefimitch
counted
out
five
hundred

latter
still
crimson
with
shame
anger
incoherently
articulated
some
useless
vow
put
cap
went
out
returning
two
hours
later
he
flopped
into
an
easy
chair
heaved
loud
sigh
said

i
not
care

before
begging

very
first
day
he

my

andrey
yefimitch
without
word
counted
out

said
eighty
six

i
tell

eighty
six
roubles
i
nothing
else
mihail
averyanitch
looked
upon
doctor
an
honourable
man
yet
he
suspected
that
he
accumulated
fortune
least
twenty
thousand
now
learning
that
andrey
yefimitch
was
beggar
that
he
nothing
live
he
was
some
reason
suddenly
moved
tears
embraced
friend
xv
andrey
yefimitch
now
lodged
little
house
with
three
windows
there
were
only
three
rooms
besides
kitchen
little
house
doctor
lived
two
them
which
looked
into
street
while
daryushka
landlady
with

sometimes
landladys

who
was
rowdy
reduced
children
daryushka
terror
would
come
night
when
he
arrived
established
himself
kitchen
demanded
vodka
they
felt
very
uncomfortable
doctor
would
moved
by
pity
take
crying
children
into
room
let
them
lie
floor
this
gave
him
great
satisfaction
he
got
before
eight
oclock
after
morning
tea
sat
down
read
old
books
magazines
he
money
new
ones
either
because
books
were
old
or
perhaps
because
change
surroundings
reading
exhausted
him
did
not
grip
attention
before
that
he
might
not
spend
time
idleness
he
made
detailed
catalogue
books
gummed
little
labels
their
backs
this
mechanical
tedious
work
seemed
him
more
interesting
than
reading
monotonous
tedious
work
lulled
thoughts
sleep
some
unaccountable
way
time
passed
quickly
while
he
thought
nothing
even
sitting
kitchen
peeling
potatoes
with
daryushka
or
picking
over
buckwheat
grain
seemed
him
interesting
saturdays
sundays
he
went
church
standing
near
wall
half
closing
eyes
he
listened
singing
thought
father
mother
university
religions
world
he
felt
calm
melancholy
he
went
out
church
afterwards
he
regretted
that
service
was
so
soon
over
he
went
twice
hospital
talk
ivan
dmitritch
but
both
occasions
ivan
dmitritch
was
unusually
excited
ill
humoured
he
bade
doctor
leave
him
peace
he
long
been
sick
empty
chatter
declared
make
sufferings
he
asked
from
damned
scoundrels
only
one
favour
solitary
confinement
surely
they
would
not
refuse
him
even
that
both
occasions
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
taking
leave
him
wishing
him
good
night
he
answered
rudely
said
go
hell
andrey
yefimitch
did
not
know
now
whether
go
him
third
time
or
not
he
longed
go
old
days
andrey
yefimitch
used
walk
about
rooms
think
interval
after
dinner
but
now
from
dinner
time
till
evening
tea
he
lay
sofa
with
face
back
gave
himself
trivial
thoughts
which
he
could
not
struggle
against
he
was
mortified
that
after
more
than
twenty
years
service
he
been
given
neither
pension
nor
any
assistance
it
true
that
he
not
done
work
honestly
but
then
who
service
get
pension
without
distinction
whether
they
honest
or
not
contemporary
justice
lies
precisely
bestowal
grades
orders
pensions
not
moral
qualities
or
capacities
but
service
whatever
it
may
been
like
why
was
he
alone
an
exception
he
money
he
was
ashamed
pass
by
shop
look
woman
who
owned
it
he
owed
thirty
two
roubles
beer
already
there
was
money
owing
landlady
also
daryushka
sold
old
clothes
books
sly
told
lies
landlady
saying
that
doctor
was
just
going
receive
large
sum
money
he
was
angry
with
himself
having
wasted
travelling
thousand
roubles
he
saved
how
useful
that
thousand
roubles
would
been
now
he
was
vexed
that
people
would
not
leave
him
peace
hobotov
thought
it
duty
look
sick
colleague
from
time
time
everything
about
him
was
revolting
andrey
yefimitch
well
fed
face
vulgar
condescending
tone
use
word
colleague
high
top
boots
most
revolting
thing
was
that
he
thought
it
was
duty
treat
andrey
yefimitch
thought
that
he
really
was
treating
him
every
visit
he
brought
bottle
bromide
rhubarb
pills
mihail
averyanitch
too
thought
it
duty
visit
friend
entertain
him
every
time
he
went
andrey
yefimitch
with
an
affectation
ease
laughed
constrainedly
began
assuring
him
that
he
was
looking
very
well
day
that
thank
god
he
was
highroad
recovery
from
this
it
might
concluded
that
he
looked
friends
condition
hopeless
he
not
yet
repaid
warsaw
debt
was
overwhelmed
by
shame
he
was
constrained
so
tried
laugh
louder
talk
more
amusingly
anecdotes
descriptions
seemed
endless
now
were
an
agony
both
andrey
yefimitch
himself
presence
andrey
yefimitch
usually
lay
sofa
with
face
wall
listened
with
teeth
clenched
soul
was
oppressed
with
rankling
disgust
after
every
visit
from
friend
he
felt
though
this
disgust
risen
higher
was
mounting
into
throat
stifle
petty
thoughts
he
made
haste
reflect
that
he
himself
hobotov
mihail
averyanitch
would
sooner
or
later
perish
without
leaving
any
trace
world
if
one
imagined
some
spirit
flying
by
earthly
globe
space
million
years
he
would
see
nothing
but
clay
bare
rocks
everything
culture
moral
law
would
pass
away
not
even
burdock
would
grow
out
them
what
consequence
was
shame
presence
shopkeeper
what
consequence
was
insignificant
hobotov
or
wearisome
friendship
mihail
averyanitch
it
was
trivial
nonsensical
but
such
reflections
did
not
help
him
now
scarcely
he
imagined
earthly
globe
million
years
when
hobotov
high
top
boots
or
mihail
averyanitch
with
forced
laugh
would
appear
from
behind
bare
rock
he
even
heard
shamefaced
whisper
warsaw
debt
i
will
repay
it

with
irritation
there

what
i
experiencing
now
when

crowding
grating
that

got
began

though
nothing

day
before

business
colleague

thinking
that

mind
with

perhaps
really
enable
him
earn
something
andrey
yefimitch
put
coat
hat
went
out
with
him
into
street
he
was
glad
opportunity
smooth
over
fault
previous
day
reconciled
heart
thanked
hobotov
who
did
not
even
allude
yesterdays
scene
was
evidently
sparing
him
one
would
never
expected
such
delicacy
from
this
uncultured
man
where
your
invalid
asked
andrey

said
an
undertone
going

he
went
away
xvii
it
was
getting

thrust
unto

paralytic
was
sitting
motionless
crying
quietly
moving
lips
fat
peasant
former
sorter
were
asleep
it
was
quiet
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
ivan
dmitritchs
bed
waited
but
half
an
hour
passed
instead
hobotov
nikita
came
into

with
dressing

some
underlinen
pair
slippers
heap
arm

brought
into

andrey
yefimitch
understood
it
without
saying
word
he
crossed
bed
which
nikita
pointed
sat
down
seeing
that
nikita
was
standing
waiting
he
undressed
entirely
he
felt
ashamed
then
he
put

very
short

long

smelt
smoked
fish
please

repeated
nikita
he
gathered
andrey
yefimitchs
clothes
into
arms
went
out
shut
door
after
him
matter
thought
andrey
yefimitch
wrapping
himself
dressing
gown
shamefaced
way
feeling
that
he
looked
like
convict
new
costume
its
matter
it
does
not
matter
whether
its
dress
coat
or
uniform
or
this
dressing
gown
but
how
about
watch
notebook
that
was
side
pocket
cigarettes
where
nikita
taken
clothes
now
perhaps
day
death
he
would
not
put
trousers
waistcoat
high
boots
it
was
somehow
strange
even
incomprehensible
first
andrey
yefimitch
was
even
now
convinced
that
there
was
difference
between
landladys
house
ward
that
everything
this
world
was
nonsense
vanity
vanities
yet
hands
were
trembling
feet
were
cold
he
was
filled
with
dread
thought
that
soon
ivan
dmitritch
would
get
see
that
he
was
dressing
gown
he
got
walked
across
room
sat
down
again
here
he
been
sitting
already
half
an
hour
an
hour
he
was
miserably
sick
it
was
it
really
possible
live
here
day
week
even
years
like
these
people
why
he
been
sitting
here
walked
about
sat
down
again
he
could
get
look
out
window
walk
from
corner
corner
again
then
what
sit
so
time
like
post
think
that
was
scarcely
possible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
but
got
wiped
cold
sweat
from
brow
with
sleeve
felt
that
whole
face
smelt
smoked
fish
he
walked
about
again
its
some
misunderstanding
he
said
turning
out
palms
hands
perplexity
it
must
cleared
there
misunderstanding
meanwhile
ivan
dmitritch
woke
he
sat
propped
cheeks
fists
he
spat
then
he
glanced
lazily
doctor
apparently
first
minute
did
not
understand
but
soon
sleepy
face
grew
malicious
mocking
aha
so
they
put
you
here
too
old
fellow
he
said
voice
husky
from
sleepiness
screwing
one
eye
very
glad
see
you
you
sucked
blood
others
now
they
will
suck
yours
excellent
its
misunderstanding
andrey
yefimitch
brought
out
frightened
by
ivan
dmitritchs
words
he
shrugged
shoulders
repeated
its
some
misunderstanding
ivan
dmitritch
spat
again
lay
down
cursed
life
he
grumbled
whats
bitter
insulting
this
life
will
not
end
compensation
our
sufferings
it
will
not
end
with
apotheosis
it
would
an
opera
but
with
death
peasants
will
come
drag
ones
dead
body
by
arms
legs
cellar
ugh
well
it
does
not
matter

from

returned
seeing
doctor
held
out
hand
give
me
one
little
kopeck
he
said
xviii
andrey
yefimitch
walked
away
window
looked
out
into
open
country
it
was
getting
dark
horizon
right
cold
crimson
moon
was
mounting
upwards
not
far
from
hospital
fence
not
much
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
stood
tall
white
house
shut
by
stone
wall
this
was
prison
so
this
real
life
thought
andrey
yefimitch
he
felt
frightened
moon
prison
nails
fence
far
away
flames
bone
charring
factory
were
terrible
behind
him
there
was
sound
sigh
andrey
yefimitch
looked
round
saw
man
with
glittering
stars
orders
breast
who
was
smiling
slyly
winking
this
too
seemed
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
assured
himself
that
there
was
nothing
special
about
moon
or
prison
that
even
sane
persons
wear
orders
that
everything
time
will
decay
turn
earth
but
he
was
suddenly
overcome
with
desire
he
clutched
grating
with
both
hands
shook
it
with
might
strong
grating
did
not
yield
then
that
it
might
not
so
dreadful
he
went
ivan
dmitritchs
bed
sat
down
i
lost
heart
my
dear
fellow
he
muttered
trembling
wiping
away
cold
sweat
i
lost
heart

philosophical
said
ivan
dmitritch
ironically
my
god
my
god
yes
yes
you
were
pleased
say
that
there
was
philosophy
russia
but
that
people
even
paltriest
talk
philosophy
but
you
know
philosophizing
paltriest
does
not
harm
anyone
said
andrey
yefimitch
tone
if
he
wanted
cry
complain
why
then
that
malignant
laugh
my
friend
how
these
paltry
creatures
help
philosophizing
if
they
not
satisfied
an
intelligent
educated
man
made
gods
image
proud
loving
freedom
alternative
but
doctor
filthy
stupid
wretched
little
town
spend
whole
life
among
bottles
leeches
mustard
plasters
quackery
narrowness
vulgarity
oh

talking
nonsense
if
you
dont
like
being
doctor
you
should
gone
being
statesman
i
could
not
i
could
not
anything
weak
my
dear
friend
i
used

boldly
soundly
but
first
coarse
touch
life
upon
me
i
lost
heart
prostration
weak
poor
creatures
you
too
my
dear
friend
you
intelligent
generous
you
drew
good
impulses
with
your
mothers
milk
but
you
hardly
entered
upon
life
when
you
were
exhausted
fell
ill
weak
weak
andrey
yefimitch
was
while
approach
evening
tormented
by
another
persistent
sensation
besides
terror
feeling
resentment
last
he
realized
that
he
was
longing
smoke
beer
i
going

my
friend
he
said

said
trembling
voice

nikita
said
peremptorily
this
beyond

ivan
dmitritch
cried
suddenly
he
jumped
what

dare
they

himself
upon

nikita
opened
door
quickly
roughly
with
both
hands
knee
shoved
andrey
yefimitch
back
then
swung
arm
punched
him
face
with
fist
it
seemed
andrey
yefimitch
though
huge
salt
wave
enveloped
him
from
head
downwards
dragged
him
bed
there
really
was
salt
taste
mouth
most
likely
blood
was
running
from
teeth
he
waved
arms

were
trying

moment
felt
nikita
hit
him
twice
back
ivan
dmitritch
gave
loud
scream
he
must
been
beaten

moonlight
came
through
grating
shadow
like
net
lay
floor
it
was
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
held
breath
he
was
expecting
with
horror
struck
again
he
felt
though
someone
taken
sickle
thrust
it
into
him
turned
it
round
several
times
breast
bowels
he
bit
pillow
from
pain
clenched
teeth
through
chaos
brain
there
flashed
terrible
unbearable
thought
that
these
people
who
seemed
now
like
black
shadows
moonlight
endure
such
pain
day
by
day
years
how
could
it
happened
that
more
than
twenty
years
he
not
known
it
refused
know
it
he
knew
nothing
pain
conception
it
so
he
was
not
blame
but
conscience
inexorable
rough
nikita
made
him
turn
cold
from
crown
head
heels
he
leaped
tried
cry
out
with
might
run

cowardly
even
been
afraid

openly
expressed
thoughts
feelings
such
he
not
expected
himself
before

thought
that
paltry
people
who
philosophized
were
really
dissatisfied
but
now
nothing
mattered
him
he
ate
nothing
he
drank
nothing

lay
motionless
silent
