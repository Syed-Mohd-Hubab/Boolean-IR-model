ward
no
in
the
hospital
yard
there
stands
a
small
lodge
surrounded
by
a
perfect
forest
of
burdocks
nettles
and
wild
hemp
its
roof
is
rusty
the
chimney
is
tumbling
down
the
steps
at
the
front
door
are
rotting
away
and
overgrown
with
grass
and
there
are
only
traces
left
of
the
stucco
the
front
of
the
lodge
faces
the
hospital
at
the
back
it
looks
out
into
the
open
country
from
which
it
is
separated
by
the
grey
hospital
fence
with
nails
on
it
these
nails
with
their
points
upwards
and
the
fence
and
the
lodge
itself
have
that
peculiar
desolate
god
forsaken
look
which
is
only
found
in
our
hospital
and
prison
buildings
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
stung
by
the
nettles
come
by
the
narrow
footpath
that
leads
to
the
lodge
and
let
us
see
what
is
going
on
inside
opening
the
first
door
we
walk
into
the
entry
here
along
the
walls
and
by
the
stove
every
sort
of
hospital
rubbish
lies
littered
about
mattresses
old
tattered
dressing
gowns
trousers
blue
striped
shirts
boots
and
shoes
no
good
for
anythingall
these
remnants
are
piled
up
in
heaps
mixed
up
and
crumpled
mouldering
and
giving
out
a
sickly
smell
the
porter
nikita
an
old
soldier
wearing
rusty
good
conduct
stripes
is
always
lying
on
the
litter
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
has
a
grim
surly
battered
looking
face
overhanging
eyebrows
which
give
him
the
expression
of
a
sheep
dog
of
the
steppes
and
a
red
nose
he
is
short
and
looks
thin
and
scraggy
but
he
is
of
imposing
deportment
and
his
fists
are
vigorous
he
belongs
to
the
class
of
simple
hearted
practical
and
dull
witted
people
prompt
in
carrying
out
orders
who
like
discipline
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
so
are
convinced
that
it
is
their
duty
to
beat
people
he
showers
blows
on
the
face
on
the
chest
on
the
back
on
whatever
comes
first
and
is
convinced
that
there
would
be
no
order
in
the
place
if
he
did
not
next
you
come
into
a
big
spacious
room
which
fills
up
the
whole
lodge
except
for
the
entry
here
the
walls
are
painted
a
dirty
blue
the
ceiling
is
as
sooty
as
in
a
hut
without
a
chimneyit
is
evident
that
in
the
winter
the
stove
smokes
and
the
room
is
full
of
fumes
the
windows
are
disfigured
by
iron
gratings
on
the
inside
the
wooden
floor
is
grey
and
full
of
splinters
there
is
a
stench
of
sour
cabbage
of
smouldering
wicks
of
bugs
and
of
ammonia
and
for
the
first
minute
this
stench
gives
you
the
impression
of
having
walked
into
a
menagerie
there
are
bedsteads
screwed
to
the
floor
men
in
blue
hospital
dressing
gowns
and
wearing
nightcaps
in
the
old
style
are
sitting
and
lying
on
them
these
are
the
lunatics
there
are
five
of
them
in
all
here
only
one
is
of
the
upper
class
the
rest
are
all
artisans
the
one
nearest
the
doora
tall
lean
workman
with
shining
red
whiskers
and
tear
stained
eyessits
with
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
staring
at
the
same
point
day
and
night
he
grieves
shaking
his
head
sighing
and
smiling
bitterly
he
takes
a
part
in
conversation
and
usually
makes
no
answer
to
questions
he
eats
and
drinks
mechanically
when
food
is
offered
him
from
his
agonizing
throbbing
cough
his
thinness
and
the
flush
on
his
cheeks
one
may
judge
that
he
is
in
the
first
stage
of
consumption
next
to
him
is
a
little
alert
very
lively
old
man
with
a
pointed
beard
and
curly
black
hair
like
a
negros
by
day
he
walks
up
and
down
the
ward
from
window
to
window
or
sits
on
his
bed
cross
legged
like
a
turk
and
ceaselessly
as
a
bullfinch
whistles
softly
sings
and
titters
he
shows
his
childish
gaiety
and
lively
character
at
night
also
when
he
gets
up
to
say
his
prayersthat
is
to
beat
himself
on
the
chest
with
his
fists
and
to
scratch
with
his
fingers
at
the
door
this
is
the
jew
moiseika
an
imbecile
who
went
crazy
twenty
years
ago
when
his
hat
factory
was
burnt
down
and
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
ward
no
he
is
the
only
one
who
is
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
lodge
and
even
out
of
the
yard
into
the
street
he
has
enjoyed
this
privilege
for
years
probably
because
he
is
an
old
inhabitant
of
the
hospitala
quiet
harmless
imbecile
the
buffoon
of
the
town
where
people
are
used
to
seeing
him
surrounded
by
boys
and
dogs
in
his
wretched
gown
in
his
absurd
night
cap
and
in
slippers
sometimes
with
bare
legs
and
even
without
trousers
he
walks
about
the
streets
stopping
at
the
gates
and
little
shops
and
begging
for
a
copper
in
one
place
they
will
give
him
some
kvass
in
another
some
bread
in
another
a
copper
so
that
he
generally
goes
back
to
the
ward
feeling
rich
and
well
fed
everything
that
he
brings
back
nikita
takes
from
him
for
his
own
benefit
the
soldier
does
this
roughly
angrily
turning
the
jews
pockets
inside
out
and
calling
god
to
witness
that
he
will
not
let
him
go
into
the
street
again
and
that
breach
of
the
regulations
is
worse
to
him
than
anything
in
the
world
moiseika
likes
to
make
himself
useful
he
gives
his
companions
water
and
covers
them
up
when
they
are
asleep
he
promises
each
of
them
to
bring
him
back
a
kopeck
and
to
make
him
a
new
cap
he
feeds
with
a
spoon
his
neighbour
on
the
left
who
is
paralyzed
he
acts
in
this
way
not
from
compassion
nor
from
any
considerations
of
a
humane
kind
but
through
imitation
unconsciously
dominated
by
gromov
his
neighbour
on
the
right
hand
ivan
dmitritch
gromov
a
man
of
thirty
three
who
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
has
been
a
court
usher
and
provincial
secretary
suffers
from
the
mania
of
persecution
he
either
lies
curled
up
in
bed
or
walks
from
corner
to
corner
as
though
for
exercise
he
very
rarely
sits
down
he
is
always
excited
agitated
and
overwrought
by
a
sort
of
vague
undefined
expectation
the
faintest
rustle
in
the
entry
or
shout
in
the
yard
is
enough
to
make
him
raise
his
head
and
begin
listening
whether
they
are
coming
for
him
whether
they
are
looking
for
him
and
at
such
times
his
face
expresses
the
utmost
uneasiness
and
repulsion
i
like
his
broad
face
with
its
high
cheek
bones
always
pale
and
unhappy
and
reflecting
as
though
in
a
mirror
a
soul
tormented
by
conflict
and
long
continued
terror
his
grimaces
are
strange
and
abnormal
but
the
delicate
lines
traced
on
his
face
by
profound
genuine
suffering
show
intelligence
and
sense
and
there
is
a
warm
and
healthy
light
in
his
eyes
i
like
the
man
himself
courteous
anxious
to
be
of
use
and
extraordinarily
gentle
to
everyone
except
nikita
when
anyone
drops
a
button
or
a
spoon
he
jumps
up
from
his
bed
quickly
and
picks
it
up
every
day
he
says
good
morning
to
his
companions
and
when
he
goes
to
bed
he
wishes
them
good
night
besides
his
continually
overwrought
condition
and
his
grimaces
his
madness
shows
itself
in
the
following
way
also
sometimes
in
the
evenings
he
wraps
himself
in
his
dressing
gown
and
trembling
all
over
with
his
teeth
chattering
begins
walking
rapidly
from
corner
to
corner
and
between
the
bedsteads
it
seems
as
though
he
is
in
a
violent
fever
from
the
way
he
suddenly
stops
and
glances
at
his
companions
it
can
be
seen
that
he
is
longing
to
say
something
very
important
but
apparently
reflecting
that
they
would
not
listen
or
would
not
understand
him
he
shakes
his
head
impatiently
and
goes
on
pacing
up
and
down
but
soon
the
desire
to
speak
gets
the
upper
hand
of
every
consideration
and
he
will
let
himself
go
and
speak
fervently
and
passionately
his
talk
is
disordered
and
feverish
like
delirium
disconnected
and
not
always
intelligible
but
on
the
other
hand
something
extremely
fine
may
be
felt
in
it
both
in
the
words
and
the
voice
when
he
talks
you
recognize
in
him
the
lunatic
and
the
man
it
is
difficult
to
reproduce
on
paper
his
insane
talk
he
speaks
of
the
baseness
of
mankind
of
violence
trampling
on
justice
of
the
glorious
life
which
will
one
day
be
upon
earth
of
the
window
gratings
which
remind
him
every
minute
of
the
stupidity
and
cruelty
of
oppressors
it
makes
a
disorderly
incoherent
potpourri
of
themes
old
but
not
yet
out
of
date
ii
some
twelve
or
fifteen
years
ago
an
official
called
gromov
a
highly
respectable
and
prosperous
person
was
living
in
his
own
house
in
the
principal
street
of
the
town
he
had
two
sons
sergey
and
ivan
when
sergey
was
a
student
in
his
fourth
year
he
was
taken
ill
with
galloping
consumption
and
died
and
his
death
was
as
it
were
the
first
of
a
whole
series
of
calamities
which
suddenly
showered
on
the
gromov
family
within
a
week
of
sergeys
funeral
the
old
father
was
put
on
trial
for
fraud
and
misappropriation
and
he
died
of
typhoid
in
the
prison
hospital
soon
afterwards
the
house
with
all
their
belongings
was
sold
by
auction
and
ivan
dmitritch
and
his
mother
were
left
entirely
without
means
hitherto
in
his
fathers
lifetime
ivan
dmitritch
who
was
studying
in
the
university
of
petersburg
had
received
an
allowance
of
sixty
or
seventy
roubles
a
month
and
had
had
no
conception
of
poverty
now
he
had
to
make
an
abrupt
change
in
his
life
he
had
to
spend
his
time
from
morning
to
night
giving
lessons
for
next
to
nothing
to
work
at
copying
and
with
all
that
to
go
hungry
as
all
his
earnings
were
sent
to
keep
his
mother
ivan
dmitritch
could
not
stand
such
a
life
he
lost
heart
and
strength
and
giving
up
the
university
went
home
here
through
interest
he
obtained
the
post
of
teacher
in
the
district
school
but
could
not
get
on
with
his
colleagues
was
not
liked
by
the
boys
and
soon
gave
up
the
post
his
mother
died
he
was
for
six
months
without
work
living
on
nothing
but
bread
and
water
then
he
became
a
court
usher
he
kept
this
post
until
he
was
dismissed
owing
to
his
illness
he
had
never
even
in
his
young
student
days
given
the
impression
of
being
perfectly
healthy
he
had
always
been
pale
thin
and
given
to
catching
cold
he
ate
little
and
slept
badly
a
single
glass
of
wine
went
to
his
head
and
made
him
hysterical
he
always
had
a
craving
for
society
but
owing
to
his
irritable
temperament
and
suspiciousness
he
never
became
very
intimate
with
anyone
and
had
no
friends
he
always
spoke
with
contempt
of
his
fellow
townsmen
saying
that
their
coarse
ignorance
and
sleepy
animal
existence
seemed
to
him
loathsome
and
horrible
he
spoke
in
a
loud
tenor
with
heat
and
invariably
either
with
scorn
and
indignation
or
with
wonder
and
enthusiasm
and
always
with
perfect
sincerity
whatever
one
talked
to
him
about
he
always
brought
it
round
to
the
same
subject
that
life
was
dull
and
stifling
in
the
town
that
the
townspeople
had
no
lofty
interests
but
lived
a
dingy
meaningless
life
diversified
by
violence
coarse
profligacy
and
hypocrisy
that
scoundrels
were
well
fed
and
clothed
while
honest
men
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
that
they
needed
schools
a
progressive
local
paper
a
theatre
public
lectures
the
co
ordination
of
the
intellectual
elements
that
society
must
see
its
failings
and
be
horrified
in
his
criticisms
of
people
he
laid
on
the
colours
thick
using
only
black
and
white
and
no
fine
shades
mankind
was
divided
for
him
into
honest
men
and
scoundrels
there
was
nothing
in
between
he
always
spoke
with
passion
and
enthusiasm
of
women
and
of
love
but
he
had
never
been
in
love
in
spite
of
the
severity
of
his
judgments
and
his
nervousness
he
was
liked
and
behind
his
back
was
spoken
of
affectionately
as
vanya
his
innate
refinement
and
readiness
to
be
of
service
his
good
breeding
his
moral
purity
and
his
shabby
coat
his
frail
appearance
and
family
misfortunes
aroused
a
kind
warm
sorrowful
feeling
moreover
he
was
well
educated
and
well
read
according
to
the
townspeoples
notions
he
knew
everything
and
was
in
their
eyes
something
like
a
walking
encyclopedia
he
had
read
a
great
deal
he
would
sit
at
the
club
nervously
pulling
at
his
beard
and
looking
through
the
magazines
and
books
and
from
his
face
one
could
see
that
he
was
not
reading
but
devouring
the
pages
without
giving
himself
time
to
digest
what
he
read
it
must
be
supposed
that
reading
was
one
of
his
morbid
habits
as
he
fell
upon
anything
that
came
into
his
hands
with
equal
avidity
even
last
years
newspapers
and
calendars
at
home
he
always
read
lying
down
iii
one
autumn
morning
ivan
dmitritch
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
greatcoat
and
splashing
through
the
mud
made
his
way
by
side
streets
and
back
lanes
to
see
some
artisan
and
to
collect
some
payment
that
was
owing
he
was
in
a
gloomy
mood
as
he
always
was
in
the
morning
in
one
of
the
side
streets
he
was
met
by
two
convicts
in
fetters
and
four
soldiers
with
rifles
in
charge
of
them
ivan
dmitritch
had
very
often
met
convicts
before
and
they
had
always
excited
feelings
of
compassion
and
discomfort
in
him
but
now
this
meeting
made
a
peculiar
strange
impression
on
him
it
suddenly
seemed
to
him
for
some
reason
that
he
too
might
be
put
into
fetters
and
led
through
the
mud
to
prison
like
that
after
visiting
the
artisan
on
the
way
home
he
met
near
the
post
office
a
police
superintendent
of
his
acquaintance
who
greeted
him
and
walked
a
few
paces
along
the
street
with
him
and
for
some
reason
this
seemed
to
him
suspicious
at
home
he
could
not
get
the
convicts
or
the
soldiers
with
their
rifles
out
of
his
head
all
day
and
an
unaccountable
inward
agitation
prevented
him
from
reading
or
concentrating
his
mind
in
the
evening
he
did
not
light
his
lamp
and
at
night
he
could
not
sleep
but
kept
thinking
that
he
might
be
arrested
put
into
fetters
and
thrown
into
prison
he
did
not
know
of
any
harm
he
had
done
and
could
be
certain
that
he
would
never
be
guilty
of
murder
arson
or
theft
in
the
future
either
but
was
it
not
easy
to
commit
a
crime
by
accident
unconsciously
and
was
not
false
witness
always
possible
and
indeed
miscarriage
of
justice
it
was
not
without
good
reason
that
the
agelong
experience
of
the
simple
people
teaches
that
beggary
and
prison
are
ills
none
can
be
safe
from
a
judicial
mistake
is
very
possible
as
legal
proceedings
are
conducted
nowadays
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
wondered
at
in
it
people
who
have
an
official
professional
relation
to
other
mens
sufferingsfor
instance
judges
police
officers
doctorsin
course
of
time
through
habit
grow
so
callous
that
they
cannot
even
if
they
wish
it
take
any
but
a
formal
attitude
to
their
clients
in
this
respect
they
are
not
different
from
the
peasant
who
slaughters
sheep
and
calves
in
the
back
yard
and
does
not
notice
the
blood
with
this
formal
soulless
attitude
to
human
personality
the
judge
needs
but
one
thingtimein
order
to
deprive
an
innocent
man
of
all
rights
of
property
and
to
condemn
him
to
penal
servitude
only
the
time
spent
on
performing
certain
formalities
for
which
the
judge
is
paid
his
salary
and
thenit
is
all
over
then
you
may
look
in
vain
for
justice
and
protection
in
this
dirty
wretched
little
town
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
station
and
indeed
is
it
not
absurd
even
to
think
of
justice
when
every
kind
of
violence
is
accepted
by
society
as
a
rational
and
consistent
necessity
and
every
act
of
mercyfor
instance
a
verdict
of
acquittalcalls
forth
a
perfect
outburst
of
dissatisfied
and
revengeful
feeling
in
the
morning
ivan
dmitritch
got
up
from
his
bed
in
a
state
of
horror
with
cold
perspiration
on
his
forehead
completely
convinced
that
he
might
be
arrested
any
minute
since
his
gloomy
thoughts
of
yesterday
had
haunted
him
so
long
he
thought
it
must
be
that
there
was
some
truth
in
them
they
could
not
indeed
have
come
into
his
mind
without
any
grounds
whatever
a
policeman
walking
slowly
passed
by
the
windows
that
was
not
for
nothing
here
were
two
men
standing
still
and
silent
near
the
house
why
were
they
silent
and
agonizing
days
and
nights
followed
for
ivan
dmitritch
everyone
who
passed
by
the
windows
or
came
into
the
yard
seemed
to
him
a
spy
or
a
detective
at
midday
the
chief
of
the
police
usually
drove
down
the
street
with
a
pair
of
horses
he
was
going
from
his
estate
near
the
town
to
the
police
department
but
ivan
dmitritch
fancied
every
time
that
he
was
driving
especially
quickly
and
that
he
had
a
peculiar
expression
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
haste
to
announce
that
there
was
a
very
important
criminal
in
the
town
ivan
dmitritch
started
at
every
ring
at
the
bell
and
knock
at
the
gate
and
was
agitated
whenever
he
came
upon
anyone
new
at
his
landladys
when
he
met
police
officers
and
gendarmes
he
smiled
and
began
whistling
so
as
to
seem
unconcerned
he
could
not
sleep
for
whole
nights
in
succession
expecting
to
be
arrested
but
he
snored
loudly
and
sighed
as
though
in
deep
sleep
that
his
landlady
might
think
he
was
asleep
for
if
he
could
not
sleep
it
meant
that
he
was
tormented
by
the
stings
of
consciencewhat
a
piece
of
evidence
facts
and
common
sense
persuaded
him
that
all
these
terrors
were
nonsense
and
morbidity
that
if
one
looked
at
the
matter
more
broadly
there
was
nothing
really
terrible
in
arrest
and
imprisonmentso
long
as
the
conscience
is
at
ease
but
the
more
sensibly
and
logically
he
reasoned
the
more
acute
and
agonizing
his
mental
distress
became
it
might
be
compared
with
the
story
of
a
hermit
who
tried
to
cut
a
dwelling
place
for
himself
in
a
virgin
forest
the
more
zealously
he
worked
with
his
axe
the
thicker
the
forest
grew
in
the
end
ivan
dmitritch
seeing
it
was
useless
gave
up
reasoning
altogether
and
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
despair
and
terror
he
began
to
avoid
people
and
to
seek
solitude
his
official
work
had
been
distasteful
to
him
before
now
it
became
unbearable
to
him
he
was
afraid
they
would
somehow
get
him
into
trouble
would
put
a
bribe
in
his
pocket
unnoticed
and
then
denounce
him
or
that
he
would
accidentally
make
a
mistake
in
official
papers
that
would
appear
to
be
fraudulent
or
would
lose
other
peoples
money
it
is
strange
that
his
imagination
had
never
at
other
times
been
so
agile
and
inventive
as
now
when
every
day
he
thought
of
thousands
of
different
reasons
for
being
seriously
anxious
over
his
freedom
and
honour
but
on
the
other
hand
his
interest
in
the
outer
world
in
books
in
particular
grew
sensibly
fainter
and
his
memory
began
to
fail
him
in
the
spring
when
the
snow
melted
there
were
found
in
the
ravine
near
the
cemetery
two
half
decomposed
corpsesthe
bodies
of
an
old
woman
and
a
boy
bearing
the
traces
of
death
by
violence
nothing
was
talked
of
but
these
bodies
and
their
unknown
murderers
that
people
might
not
think
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
crime
ivan
dmitritch
walked
about
the
streets
smiling
and
when
he
met
acquaintances
he
turned
pale
flushed
and
began
declaring
that
there
was
no
greater
crime
than
the
murder
of
the
weak
and
defenceless
but
this
duplicity
soon
exhausted
him
and
after
some
reflection
he
decided
that
in
his
position
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
hide
in
his
landladys
cellar
he
sat
in
the
cellar
all
day
and
then
all
night
then
another
day
was
fearfully
cold
and
waiting
till
dusk
stole
secretly
like
a
thief
back
to
his
room
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
till
daybreak
listening
without
stirring
very
early
in
the
morning
before
sunrise
some
workmen
came
into
the
house
ivan
dmitritch
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
had
come
to
mend
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
but
terror
told
him
that
they
were
police
officers
disguised
as
workmen
he
slipped
stealthily
out
of
the
flat
and
overcome
by
terror
ran
along
the
street
without
his
cap
and
coat
dogs
raced
after
him
barking
a
peasant
shouted
somewhere
behind
him
the
wind
whistled
in
his
ears
and
it
seemed
to
ivan
dmitritch
that
the
force
and
violence
of
the
whole
world
was
massed
together
behind
his
back
and
was
chasing
after
him
he
was
stopped
and
brought
home
and
his
landlady
sent
for
a
doctor
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
of
whom
we
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
prescribed
cold
compresses
on
his
head
and
laurel
drops
shook
his
head
and
went
away
telling
the
landlady
he
should
not
come
again
as
one
should
not
interfere
with
people
who
are
going
out
of
their
minds
as
he
had
not
the
means
to
live
at
home
and
be
nursed
ivan
dmitritch
was
soon
sent
to
the
hospital
and
was
there
put
into
the
ward
for
venereal
patients
he
could
not
sleep
at
night
was
full
of
whims
and
fancies
and
disturbed
the
patients
and
was
soon
afterwards
by
andrey
yefimitchs
orders
transferred
to
ward
no
within
a
year
ivan
dmitritch
was
completely
forgotten
in
the
town
and
his
books
heaped
up
by
his
landlady
in
a
sledge
in
the
shed
were
pulled
to
pieces
by
boys
iv
ivan
dmitritchs
neighbour
on
the
left
hand
is
as
i
have
said
already
the
jew
moiseika
his
neighbour
on
the
right
hand
is
a
peasant
so
rolling
in
fat
that
he
is
almost
spherical
with
a
blankly
stupid
face
utterly
devoid
of
thought
this
is
a
motionless
gluttonous
unclean
animal
who
has
long
ago
lost
all
powers
of
thought
or
feeling
an
acrid
stifling
stench
always
comes
from
him
nikita
who
has
to
clean
up
after
him
beats
him
terribly
with
all
his
might
not
sparing
his
fists
and
what
is
dreadful
is
not
his
being
beatenthat
one
can
get
used
tobut
the
fact
that
this
stupefied
creature
does
not
respond
to
the
blows
with
a
sound
or
a
movement
nor
by
a
look
in
the
eyes
but
only
sways
a
little
like
a
heavy
barrel
the
fifth
and
last
inhabitant
of
ward
no
is
a
man
of
the
artisan
class
who
had
once
been
a
sorter
in
the
post
office
a
thinnish
fair
little
man
with
a
good
natured
but
rather
sly
face
to
judge
from
the
clear
cheerful
look
in
his
calm
and
intelligent
eyes
he
has
some
pleasant
idea
in
his
mind
and
has
some
very
important
and
agreeable
secret
he
has
under
his
pillow
and
under
his
mattress
something
that
he
never
shows
anyone
not
from
fear
of
its
being
taken
from
him
and
stolen
but
from
modesty
sometimes
he
goes
to
the
window
and
turning
his
back
to
his
companions
puts
something
on
his
breast
and
bending
his
head
looks
at
it
if
you
go
up
to
him
at
such
a
moment
he
is
overcome
with
confusion
and
snatches
something
off
his
breast
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
guess
his
secret
congratulate
me
he
often
says
to
ivan
dmitritch
i
have
been
presented
with
the
stanislav
order
of
the
second
degree
with
the
star
the
second
degree
with
the
star
is
only
given
to
foreigners
but
for
some
reason
they
want
to
make
an
exception
for
me
he
says
with
a
smile
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
perplexity
that
i
must
confess
i
did
not
expect
i
dont
understand
anything
about
that
ivan
dmitritch
replies
morosely
but
do
you
know
what
i
shall
attain
to
sooner
or
later
the
former
sorter
persists
screwing
up
his
eyes
slyly
i
shall
certainly
get
the
swedish
polar
star
thats
an
order
it
is
worth
working
for
a
white
cross
with
a
black
ribbon
its
very
beautiful
probably
in
no
other
place
is
life
so
monotonous
as
in
this
ward
in
the
morning
the
patients
except
the
paralytic
and
the
fat
peasant
wash
in
the
entry
at
a
big
tab
and
wipe
themselves
with
the
skirts
of
their
dressing
gowns
after
that
they
drink
tea
out
of
tin
mugs
which
nikita
brings
them
out
of
the
main
building
everyone
is
allowed
one
mugful
at
midday
they
have
soup
made
out
of
sour
cabbage
and
boiled
grain
in
the
evening
their
supper
consists
of
grain
left
from
dinner
in
the
intervals
they
lie
down
sleep
look
out
of
window
and
walk
from
one
corner
to
the
other
and
so
every
day
even
the
former
sorter
always
talks
of
the
same
orders
fresh
faces
are
rarely
seen
in
ward
no
the
doctor
has
not
taken
in
any
new
mental
cases
for
a
long
time
and
the
people
who
are
fond
of
visiting
lunatic
asylums
are
few
in
this
world
once
every
two
months
semyon
lazaritch
the
barber
appears
in
the
ward
how
he
cuts
the
patients
hair
and
how
nikita
helps
him
to
do
it
and
what
a
trepidation
the
lunatics
are
always
thrown
into
by
the
arrival
of
the
drunken
smiling
barber
we
will
not
describe
no
one
even
looks
into
the
ward
except
the
barber
the
patients
are
condemned
to
see
day
after
day
no
one
but
nikita
a
rather
strange
rumour
has
however
been
circulating
in
the
hospital
of
late
it
is
rumoured
that
the
doctor
has
begun
to
visit
ward
no
v
a
strange
rumour
dr
andrey
yefimitch
ragin
is
a
strange
man
in
his
way
they
say
that
when
he
was
young
he
was
very
religious
and
prepared
himself
for
a
clerical
career
and
that
when
he
had
finished
his
studies
at
the
high
school
in
he
intended
to
enter
a
theological
academy
but
that
his
father
a
surgeon
and
doctor
of
medicine
jeered
at
him
and
declared
point
blank
that
he
would
disown
him
if
he
became
a
priest
how
far
this
is
true
i
dont
know
but
andrey
yefimitch
himself
has
more
than
once
confessed
that
he
has
never
had
a
natural
bent
for
medicine
or
science
in
general
however
that
may
have
been
when
he
finished
his
studies
in
the
medical
faculty
he
did
not
enter
the
priesthood
he
showed
no
special
devoutness
and
was
no
more
like
a
priest
at
the
beginning
of
his
medical
career
than
he
is
now
his
exterior
is
heavycoarse
like
a
peasants
his
face
his
beard
his
flat
hair
and
his
coarse
clumsy
figure
suggest
an
overfed
intemperate
and
harsh
innkeeper
on
the
highroad
his
face
is
surly
looking
and
covered
with
blue
veins
his
eyes
are
little
and
his
nose
is
red
with
his
height
and
broad
shoulders
he
has
huge
hands
and
feet
one
would
think
that
a
blow
from
his
fist
would
knock
the
life
out
of
anyone
but
his
step
is
soft
and
his
walk
is
cautious
and
insinuating
when
he
meets
anyone
in
a
narrow
passage
he
is
always
the
first
to
stop
and
make
way
and
to
say
not
in
a
bass
as
one
would
expect
but
in
a
high
soft
tenor
i
beg
your
pardon
he
has
a
little
swelling
on
his
neck
which
prevents
him
from
wearing
stiff
starched
collars
and
so
he
always
goes
about
in
soft
linen
or
cotton
shirts
altogether
he
does
not
dress
like
a
doctor
he
wears
the
same
suit
for
ten
years
and
the
new
clothes
which
he
usually
buys
at
a
jewish
shop
look
as
shabby
and
crumpled
on
him
as
his
old
ones
he
sees
patients
and
dines
and
pays
visits
all
in
the
same
coat
but
this
is
not
due
to
niggardliness
but
to
complete
carelessness
about
his
appearance
when
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
town
to
take
up
his
duties
the
institution
founded
to
the
glory
of
god
was
in
a
terrible
condition
one
could
hardly
breathe
for
the
stench
in
the
wards
in
the
passages
and
in
the
courtyards
of
the
hospital
the
hospital
servants
the
nurses
and
their
children
slept
in
the
wards
together
with
the
patients
they
complained
that
there
was
no
living
for
beetles
bugs
and
mice
the
surgical
wards
were
never
free
from
erysipelas
there
were
only
two
scalpels
and
not
one
thermometer
in
the
whole
hospital
potatoes
were
kept
in
the
baths
the
superintendent
the
housekeeper
and
the
medical
assistant
robbed
the
patients
and
of
the
old
doctor
andrey
yefimitchs
predecessor
people
declared
that
he
secretly
sold
the
hospital
alcohol
and
that
he
kept
a
regular
harem
consisting
of
nurses
and
female
patients
these
disorderly
proceedings
were
perfectly
well
known
in
the
town
and
were
even
exaggerated
but
people
took
them
calmly
some
justified
them
on
the
ground
that
there
were
only
peasants
and
working
men
in
the
hospital
who
could
not
be
dissatisfied
since
they
were
much
worse
off
at
home
than
in
the
hospitalthey
couldnt
be
fed
on
woodcocks
others
said
in
excuse
that
the
town
alone
without
help
from
the
zemstvo
was
not
equal
to
maintaining
a
good
hospital
thank
god
for
having
one
at
all
even
a
poor
one
and
the
newly
formed
zemstvo
did
not
open
infirmaries
either
in
the
town
or
the
neighbourhood
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
town
already
had
its
hospital
after
looking
over
the
hospital
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
an
immoral
institution
and
extremely
prejudicial
to
the
health
of
the
townspeople
in
his
opinion
the
most
sensible
thing
that
could
be
done
was
to
let
out
the
patients
and
close
the
hospital
but
he
reflected
that
his
will
alone
was
not
enough
to
do
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
if
physical
and
moral
impurity
were
driven
out
of
one
place
they
would
only
move
to
another
one
must
wait
for
it
to
wither
away
of
itself
besides
if
people
open
a
hospital
and
put
up
with
having
it
it
must
be
because
they
need
it
superstition
and
all
the
nastiness
and
abominations
of
daily
life
were
necessary
since
in
process
of
time
they
worked
out
to
something
sensible
just
as
manure
turns
into
black
earth
there
was
nothing
on
earth
so
good
that
it
had
not
something
nasty
about
its
first
origin
when
andrey
yefimitch
undertook
his
duties
he
was
apparently
not
greatly
concerned
about
the
irregularities
at
the
hospital
he
only
asked
the
attendants
and
nurses
not
to
sleep
in
the
wards
and
had
two
cupboards
of
instruments
put
up
the
superintendent
the
housekeeper
the
medical
assistant
and
the
erysipelas
remained
unchanged
andrey
yefimitch
loved
intelligence
and
honesty
intensely
but
he
had
no
strength
of
will
nor
belief
in
his
right
to
organize
an
intelligent
and
honest
life
about
him
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
give
orders
to
forbid
things
and
to
insist
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
taken
a
vow
never
to
raise
his
voice
and
never
to
make
use
of
the
imperative
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
say
fetch
or
bring
when
he
wanted
his
meals
he
would
cough
hesitatingly
and
say
to
the
cook
how
about
tea
or
how
about
dinner
to
dismiss
the
superintendent
or
to
tell
him
to
leave
off
stealing
or
to
abolish
the
unnecessary
parasitic
post
altogether
was
absolutely
beyond
his
powers
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
deceived
or
flattered
or
accounts
he
knew
to
be
cooked
were
brought
him
to
sign
he
would
turn
as
red
as
a
crab
and
feel
guilty
but
yet
he
would
sign
the
accounts
when
the
patients
complained
to
him
of
being
hungry
or
of
the
roughness
of
the
nurses
he
would
be
confused
and
mutter
guiltily
very
well
very
well
i
will
go
into
it
later
most
likely
there
is
some
misunderstanding
at
first
andrey
yefimitch
worked
very
zealously
he
saw
patients
every
day
from
morning
till
dinner
time
performed
operations
and
even
attended
confinements
the
ladies
said
of
him
that
he
was
attentive
and
clever
at
diagnosing
diseases
especially
those
of
women
and
children
but
in
process
of
time
the
work
unmistakably
wearied
him
by
its
monotony
and
obvious
uselessness
to
day
one
sees
thirty
patients
and
to
morrow
they
have
increased
to
thirty
five
the
next
day
forty
and
so
on
from
day
to
day
from
year
to
year
while
the
mortality
in
the
town
did
not
decrease
and
the
patients
did
not
leave
off
coming
to
be
any
real
help
to
forty
patients
between
morning
and
dinner
was
not
physically
possible
so
it
could
but
lead
to
deception
if
twelve
thousand
patients
were
seen
in
a
year
it
meant
if
one
looked
at
it
simply
that
twelve
thousand
men
were
deceived
to
put
those
who
were
seriously
ill
into
wards
and
to
treat
them
according
to
the
principles
of
science
was
impossible
too
because
though
there
were
principles
there
was
no
science
if
he
were
to
put
aside
philosophy
and
pedantically
follow
the
rules
as
other
doctors
did
the
things
above
all
necessary
were
cleanliness
and
ventilation
instead
of
dirt
wholesome
nourishment
instead
of
broth
made
of
stinking
sour
cabbage
and
good
assistants
instead
of
thieves
and
indeed
why
hinder
people
dying
if
death
is
the
normal
and
legitimate
end
of
everyone
what
is
gained
if
some
shop
keeper
or
clerk
lives
an
extra
five
or
ten
years
if
the
aim
of
medicine
is
by
drugs
to
alleviate
suffering
the
question
forces
itself
on
one
why
alleviate
it
in
the
first
place
they
say
that
suffering
leads
man
to
perfection
and
in
the
second
if
mankind
really
learns
to
alleviate
its
sufferings
with
pills
and
drops
it
will
completely
abandon
religion
and
philosophy
in
which
it
has
hitherto
found
not
merely
protection
from
all
sorts
of
trouble
but
even
happiness
pushkin
suffered
terrible
agonies
before
his
death
poor
heine
lay
paralyzed
for
several
years
why
then
should
not
some
andrey
yefimitch
or
matryona
savishna
be
ill
since
their
lives
had
nothing
of
importance
in
them
and
would
have
been
entirely
empty
and
like
the
life
of
an
amoeba
except
for
suffering
oppressed
by
such
reflections
andrey
yefimitch
relaxed
his
efforts
and
gave
up
visiting
the
hospital
every
day
vi
his
life
was
passed
like
this
as
a
rule
he
got
up
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
dressed
and
drank
his
tea
then
he
sat
down
in
his
study
to
read
or
went
to
the
hospital
at
the
hospital
the
out
patients
were
sitting
in
the
dark
narrow
little
corridor
waiting
to
be
seen
by
the
doctor
the
nurses
and
the
attendants
tramping
with
their
boots
over
the
brick
floors
ran
by
them
gaunt
looking
patients
in
dressing
gowns
passed
dead
bodies
and
vessels
full
of
filth
were
carried
by
the
children
were
crying
and
there
was
a
cold
draught
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
such
surroundings
were
torture
to
feverish
consumptive
and
impressionable
patients
but
what
could
be
done
in
the
consulting
room
he
was
met
by
his
assistant
sergey
sergeyitcha
fat
little
man
with
a
plump
well
washed
shaven
face
with
soft
smooth
manners
wearing
a
new
loosely
cut
suit
and
looking
more
like
a
senator
than
a
medical
assistant
he
had
an
immense
practice
in
the
town
wore
a
white
tie
and
considered
himself
more
proficient
than
the
doctor
who
had
no
practice
in
the
corner
of
the
consulting
room
there
stood
a
large
ikon
in
a
shrine
with
a
heavy
lamp
in
front
of
it
and
near
it
a
candle
stand
with
a
white
cover
on
it
on
the
walls
hung
portraits
of
bishops
a
view
of
the
svyatogorsky
monastery
and
wreaths
of
dried
cornflowers
sergey
sergeyitch
was
religious
and
liked
solemnity
and
decorum
the
ikon
had
been
put
up
at
his
expense
at
his
instructions
some
one
of
the
patients
read
the
hymns
of
praise
in
the
consulting
room
on
sundays
and
after
the
reading
sergey
sergeyitch
himself
went
through
the
wards
with
a
censer
and
burned
incense
there
were
a
great
many
patients
but
the
time
was
short
and
so
the
work
was
confined
to
the
asking
of
a
few
brief
questions
and
the
administration
of
some
drugs
such
as
castor
oil
or
volatile
ointment
andrey
yefimitch
would
sit
with
his
cheek
resting
in
his
hand
lost
in
thought
and
asking
questions
mechanically
sergey
sergeyitch
sat
down
too
rubbing
his
hands
and
from
time
to
time
putting
in
his
word
we
suffer
pain
and
poverty
he
would
say
because
we
do
not
pray
to
the
merciful
god
as
we
should
yes
andrey
yefimitch
never
performed
any
operation
when
he
was
seeing
patients
he
had
long
ago
given
up
doing
so
and
the
sight
of
blood
upset
him
when
he
had
to
open
a
childs
mouth
in
order
to
look
at
its
throat
and
the
child
cried
and
tried
to
defend
itself
with
its
little
hands
the
noise
in
his
ears
made
his
head
go
round
and
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
would
make
haste
to
prescribe
a
drug
and
motion
to
the
woman
to
take
the
child
away
he
was
soon
wearied
by
the
timidity
of
the
patients
and
their
incoherence
by
the
proximity
of
the
pious
sergey
sergeyitch
by
the
portraits
on
the
walls
and
by
his
own
questions
which
he
had
asked
over
and
over
again
for
twenty
years
and
he
would
go
away
after
seeing
five
or
six
patients
the
rest
would
be
seen
by
his
assistant
in
his
absence
with
the
agreeable
thought
that
thank
god
he
had
no
private
practice
now
and
that
no
one
would
interrupt
him
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
to
the
table
immediately
on
reaching
home
and
took
up
a
book
he
read
a
great
deal
and
always
with
enjoyment
half
his
salary
went
on
buying
books
and
of
the
six
rooms
that
made
up
his
abode
three
were
heaped
up
with
books
and
old
magazines
he
liked
best
of
all
works
on
history
and
philosophy
the
only
medical
publication
to
which
he
subscribed
was
the
doctor
of
which
he
always
read
the
last
pages
first
he
would
always
go
on
reading
for
several
hours
without
a
break
and
without
being
weary
he
did
not
read
as
rapidly
and
impulsively
as
ivan
dmitritch
had
done
in
the
past
but
slowly
and
with
concentration
often
pausing
over
a
passage
which
he
liked
or
did
not
find
intelligible
near
the
books
there
always
stood
a
decanter
of
vodka
and
a
salted
cucumber
or
a
pickled
apple
lay
beside
it
not
on
a
plate
but
on
the
baize
table
cloth
every
half
hour
he
would
pour
himself
out
a
glass
of
vodka
and
drink
it
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
book
then
without
looking
at
it
he
would
feel
for
the
cucumber
and
bite
off
a
bit
at
three
oclock
he
would
go
cautiously
to
the
kitchen
door
cough
and
say
daryushka
what
about
dinner
after
his
dinnera
rather
poor
and
untidily
served
oneandrey
yefimitch
would
walk
up
and
down
his
rooms
with
his
arms
folded
thinking
the
clock
would
strike
four
then
five
and
still
he
would
be
walking
up
and
down
thinking
occasionally
the
kitchen
door
would
creak
and
the
red
and
sleepy
face
of
daryushka
would
appear
andrey
yefimitch
isnt
it
time
for
you
to
have
your
beer
she
would
ask
anxiously
no
its
not
time
yet
he
would
answer
ill
wait
a
little
ill
wait
a
little
towards
the
evening
the
postmaster
mihail
averyanitch
the
only
man
in
town
whose
society
did
not
bore
andrey
yefimitch
would
come
in
mihail
averyanitch
had
once
been
a
very
rich
landowner
and
had
served
in
the
calvary
but
had
come
to
ruin
and
was
forced
by
poverty
to
take
a
job
in
the
post
office
late
in
life
he
had
a
hale
and
hearty
appearance
luxuriant
grey
whiskers
the
manners
of
a
well
bred
man
and
a
loud
pleasant
voice
he
was
good
natured
and
emotional
but
hot
tempered
when
anyone
in
the
post
office
made
a
protest
expressed
disagreement
or
even
began
to
argue
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
shake
all
over
and
shout
in
a
voice
of
thunder
hold
your
tongue
so
that
the
post
office
had
long
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
an
institution
which
it
was
terrible
to
visit
mihail
averyanitch
liked
and
respected
andrey
yefimitch
for
his
culture
and
the
loftiness
of
his
soul
he
treated
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
town
superciliously
as
though
they
were
his
subordinates
here
i
am
he
would
say
going
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
good
evening
my
dear
fellow
ill
be
bound
you
are
getting
sick
of
me
arent
you
on
the
contrary
i
am
delighted
said
the
doctor
i
am
always
glad
to
see
you
the
friends
would
sit
on
the
sofa
in
the
study
and
for
some
time
would
smoke
in
silence
daryushka
what
about
the
beer
andrey
yefimitch
would
say
they
would
drink
their
first
bottle
still
in
silence
the
doctor
brooding
and
mihail
averyanitch
with
a
gay
and
animated
face
like
a
man
who
has
something
very
interesting
to
tell
the
doctor
was
always
the
one
to
begin
the
conversation
what
a
pity
he
would
say
quietly
and
slowly
not
looking
his
friend
in
the
face
he
never
looked
anyone
in
the
facewhat
a
great
pity
it
is
that
there
are
no
people
in
our
town
who
are
capable
of
carrying
on
intelligent
and
interesting
conversation
or
care
to
do
so
it
is
an
immense
privation
for
us
even
the
educated
class
do
not
rise
above
vulgarity
the
level
of
their
development
i
assure
you
is
not
a
bit
higher
than
that
of
the
lower
orders
perfectly
true
i
agree
you
know
of
course
the
doctor
went
on
quietly
and
deliberately
that
everything
in
this
world
is
insignificant
and
uninteresting
except
the
higher
spiritual
manifestations
of
the
human
mind
intellect
draws
a
sharp
line
between
the
animals
and
man
suggests
the
divinity
of
the
latter
and
to
some
extent
even
takes
the
place
of
the
immortality
which
does
not
exist
consequently
the
intellect
is
the
only
possible
source
of
enjoyment
we
see
and
hear
of
no
trace
of
intellect
about
us
so
we
are
deprived
of
enjoyment
we
have
books
it
is
true
but
that
is
not
at
all
the
same
as
living
talk
and
converse
if
you
will
allow
me
to
make
a
not
quite
apt
comparison
books
are
the
printed
score
while
talk
is
the
singing
perfectly
true
a
silence
would
follow
daryushka
would
come
out
of
the
kitchen
and
with
an
expression
of
blank
dejection
would
stand
in
the
doorway
to
listen
with
her
face
propped
on
her
fist
eh
mihail
averyanitch
would
sigh
to
expect
intelligence
of
this
generation
and
he
would
describe
how
wholesome
entertaining
and
interesting
life
had
been
in
the
past
how
intelligent
the
educated
class
in
russia
used
to
be
and
what
lofty
ideas
it
had
of
honour
and
friendship
how
they
used
to
lend
money
without
an
iou
and
it
was
thought
a
disgrace
not
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
a
comrade
in
need
and
what
campaigns
what
adventures
what
skirmishes
what
comrades
what
women
and
the
caucasus
what
a
marvellous
country
the
wife
of
a
battalion
commander
a
queer
woman
used
to
put
on
an
officers
uniform
and
drive
off
into
the
mountains
in
the
evening
alone
without
a
guide
it
was
said
that
she
had
a
love
affair
with
some
princeling
in
the
native
village
queen
of
heaven
holy
mother
daryushka
would
sigh
and
how
we
drank
and
how
we
ate
and
what
desperate
liberals
we
were
andrey
yefimitch
would
listen
without
hearing
he
was
musing
as
he
sipped
his
beer
i
often
dream
of
intellectual
people
and
conversation
with
them
he
said
suddenly
interrupting
mihail
averyanitch
my
father
gave
me
an
excellent
education
but
under
the
influence
of
the
ideas
of
the
sixties
made
me
become
a
doctor
i
believe
if
i
had
not
obeyed
him
then
by
now
i
should
have
been
in
the
very
centre
of
the
intellectual
movement
most
likely
i
should
have
become
a
member
of
some
university
of
course
intellect
too
is
transient
and
not
eternal
but
you
know
why
i
cherish
a
partiality
for
it
life
is
a
vexatious
trap
when
a
thinking
man
reaches
maturity
and
attains
to
full
consciousness
he
cannot
help
feeling
that
he
is
in
a
trap
from
which
there
is
no
escape
indeed
he
is
summoned
without
his
choice
by
fortuitous
circumstances
from
non
existence
into
life
what
for
he
tries
to
find
out
the
meaning
and
object
of
his
existence
he
is
told
nothing
or
he
is
told
absurdities
he
knocks
and
it
is
not
opened
to
him
death
comes
to
himalso
without
his
choice
and
so
just
as
in
prison
men
held
together
by
common
misfortune
feel
more
at
ease
when
they
are
together
so
one
does
not
notice
the
trap
in
life
when
people
with
a
bent
for
analysis
and
generalization
meet
together
and
pass
their
time
in
the
interchange
of
proud
and
free
ideas
in
that
sense
the
intellect
is
the
source
of
an
enjoyment
nothing
can
replace
perfectly
true
not
looking
his
friend
in
the
face
andrey
yefimitch
would
go
on
quietly
and
with
pauses
talking
about
intellectual
people
and
conversation
with
them
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
listen
attentively
and
agree
perfectly
true
and
you
do
not
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
would
ask
suddenly
no
honoured
mihail
averyanitch
i
do
not
believe
it
and
have
no
grounds
for
believing
it
i
must
own
i
doubt
it
too
and
yet
i
have
a
feeling
as
though
i
should
never
die
oh
i
think
to
myself
old
fogey
it
is
time
you
were
dead
but
there
is
a
little
voice
in
my
soul
says
dont
believe
it
you
wont
die
soon
after
nine
oclock
mihail
averyanitch
would
go
away
as
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
in
the
entry
he
would
say
with
a
sigh
what
a
wilderness
fate
has
carried
us
to
though
really
whats
most
vexatious
of
all
is
to
have
to
die
here
ech
vii
after
seeing
his
friend
out
andrey
yefimitch
would
sit
down
at
the
table
and
begin
reading
again
the
stillness
of
the
evening
and
afterwards
of
the
night
was
not
broken
by
a
single
sound
and
it
seemed
as
though
time
were
standing
still
and
brooding
with
the
doctor
over
the
book
and
as
though
there
were
nothing
in
existence
but
the
books
and
the
lamp
with
the
green
shade
the
doctors
coarse
peasant
like
face
was
gradually
lighted
up
by
a
smile
of
delight
and
enthusiasm
over
the
progress
of
the
human
intellect
oh
why
is
not
man
immortal
he
thought
what
is
the
good
of
the
brain
centres
and
convolutions
what
is
the
good
of
sight
speech
self
consciousness
genius
if
it
is
all
destined
to
depart
into
the
soil
and
in
the
end
to
grow
cold
together
with
the
earths
crust
and
then
for
millions
of
years
to
fly
with
the
earth
round
the
sun
with
no
meaning
and
no
object
to
do
that
there
was
no
need
at
all
to
draw
man
with
his
lofty
almost
godlike
intellect
out
of
non
existence
and
then
as
though
in
mockery
to
turn
him
into
clay
the
transmutation
of
substances
but
what
cowardice
to
comfort
oneself
with
that
cheap
substitute
for
immortality
the
unconscious
processes
that
take
place
in
nature
are
lower
even
than
the
stupidity
of
man
since
in
stupidity
there
is
anyway
consciousness
and
will
while
in
those
processes
there
is
absolutely
nothing
only
the
coward
who
has
more
fear
of
death
than
dignity
can
comfort
himself
with
the
fact
that
his
body
will
in
time
live
again
in
the
grass
in
the
stones
in
the
toad
to
find
ones
immortality
in
the
transmutation
of
substances
is
as
strange
as
to
prophesy
a
brilliant
future
for
the
case
after
a
precious
violin
has
been
broken
and
become
useless
when
the
clock
struck
andrey
yefimitch
would
sink
back
into
his
chair
and
close
his
eyes
to
think
a
little
and
under
the
influence
of
the
fine
ideas
of
which
he
had
been
reading
he
would
unawares
recall
his
past
and
his
present
the
past
was
hatefulbetter
not
to
think
of
it
and
it
was
the
same
in
the
present
as
in
the
past
he
knew
that
at
the
very
time
when
his
thoughts
were
floating
together
with
the
cooling
earth
round
the
sun
in
the
main
building
beside
his
abode
people
were
suffering
in
sickness
and
physical
impurity
someone
perhaps
could
not
sleep
and
was
making
war
upon
the
insects
someone
was
being
infected
by
erysipelas
or
moaning
over
too
tight
a
bandage
perhaps
the
patients
were
playing
cards
with
the
nurses
and
drinking
vodka
according
to
the
yearly
return
twelve
thousand
people
had
been
deceived
the
whole
hospital
rested
as
it
had
done
twenty
years
ago
on
thieving
filth
scandals
gossip
on
gross
quackery
and
as
before
it
was
an
immoral
institution
extremely
injurious
to
the
health
of
the
inhabitants
he
knew
that
nikita
knocked
the
patients
about
behind
the
barred
windows
of
ward
no
and
that
moiseika
went
about
the
town
every
day
begging
alms
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
very
well
that
a
magical
change
had
taken
place
in
medicine
during
the
last
twenty
five
years
when
he
was
studying
at
the
university
he
had
fancied
that
medicine
would
soon
be
overtaken
by
the
fate
of
alchemy
and
metaphysics
but
now
when
he
was
reading
at
night
the
science
of
medicine
touched
him
and
excited
his
wonder
and
even
enthusiasm
what
unexpected
brilliance
what
a
revolution
thanks
to
the
antiseptic
system
operations
were
performed
such
as
the
great
pirogov
had
considered
impossible
even
in
spe
ordinary
zemstvo
doctors
were
venturing
to
perform
the
resection
of
the
kneecap
of
abdominal
operations
only
one
per
cent
was
fatal
while
stone
was
considered
such
a
trifle
that
they
did
not
even
write
about
it
a
radical
cure
for
syphilis
had
been
discovered
and
the
theory
of
heredity
hypnotism
the
discoveries
of
pasteur
and
of
koch
hygiene
based
on
statistics
and
the
work
of
zemstvo
doctors
psychiatry
with
its
modern
classification
of
mental
diseases
methods
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
was
a
perfect
elborus
in
comparison
with
what
had
been
in
the
past
they
no
longer
poured
cold
water
on
the
heads
of
lunatics
nor
put
strait
waistcoats
upon
them
they
treated
them
with
humanity
and
even
so
it
was
stated
in
the
papers
got
up
balls
and
entertainments
for
them
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
with
modern
tastes
and
views
such
an
abomination
as
ward
no
was
possible
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
in
a
little
town
where
the
mayor
and
all
the
town
council
were
half
illiterate
tradesmen
who
looked
upon
the
doctor
as
an
oracle
who
must
be
believed
without
any
criticism
even
if
he
had
poured
molten
lead
into
their
mouths
in
any
other
place
the
public
and
the
newspapers
would
long
ago
have
torn
this
little
bastille
to
pieces
but
after
all
what
of
it
andrey
yefimitch
would
ask
himself
opening
his
eyes
there
is
the
antiseptic
system
there
is
koch
there
is
pasteur
but
the
essential
reality
is
not
altered
a
bit
ill
health
and
mortality
are
still
the
same
they
get
up
balls
and
entertainments
for
the
mad
but
still
they
dont
let
them
go
free
so
its
all
nonsense
and
vanity
and
there
is
no
difference
in
reality
between
the
best
vienna
clinic
and
my
hospital
but
depression
and
a
feeling
akin
to
envy
prevented
him
from
feeling
indifferent
it
must
have
been
owing
to
exhaustion
his
heavy
head
sank
on
to
the
book
he
put
his
hands
under
his
face
to
make
it
softer
and
thought
i
serve
in
a
pernicious
institution
and
receive
a
salary
from
people
whom
i
am
deceiving
i
am
not
honest
but
then
i
of
myself
am
nothing
i
am
only
part
of
an
inevitable
social
evil
all
local
officials
are
pernicious
and
receive
their
salary
for
doing
nothing
and
so
for
my
dishonesty
it
is
not
i
who
am
to
blame
but
the
times
if
i
had
been
born
two
hundred
years
later
i
should
have
been
different
when
it
struck
three
he
would
put
out
his
lamp
and
go
into
his
bedroom
he
was
not
sleepy
viii
two
years
before
the
zemstvo
in
a
liberal
mood
had
decided
to
allow
three
hundred
roubles
a
year
to
pay
for
additional
medical
service
in
the
town
till
the
zemstvo
hospital
should
be
opened
and
the
district
doctor
yevgeny
fyodoritch
hobotov
was
invited
to
the
town
to
assist
andrey
yefimitch
he
was
a
very
young
mannot
yet
thirtytall
and
dark
with
broad
cheek
bones
and
little
eyes
his
forefathers
had
probably
come
from
one
of
the
many
alien
races
of
russia
he
arrived
in
the
town
without
a
farthing
with
a
small
portmanteau
and
a
plain
young
woman
whom
he
called
his
cook
this
woman
had
a
baby
at
the
breast
yevgeny
fyodoritch
used
to
go
about
in
a
cap
with
a
peak
and
in
high
boots
and
in
the
winter
wore
a
sheepskin
he
made
great
friends
with
sergey
sergeyitch
the
medical
assistant
and
with
the
treasurer
but
held
aloof
from
the
other
officials
and
for
some
reason
called
them
aristocrats
he
had
only
one
book
in
his
lodgings
the
latest
prescriptions
of
the
vienna
clinic
for
when
he
went
to
a
patient
he
always
took
this
book
with
him
he
played
billiards
in
the
evening
at
the
club
he
did
not
like
cards
he
was
very
fond
of
using
in
conversation
such
expressions
as
endless
bobbery
canting
soft
soap
shut
up
with
your
finicking
he
visited
the
hospital
twice
a
week
made
the
round
of
the
wards
and
saw
out
patients
the
complete
absence
of
antiseptic
treatment
and
the
cupping
roused
his
indignation
but
he
did
not
introduce
any
new
system
being
afraid
of
offending
andrey
yefimitch
he
regarded
his
colleague
as
a
sly
old
rascal
suspected
him
of
being
a
man
of
large
means
and
secretly
envied
him
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
his
post
ix
on
a
spring
evening
towards
the
end
of
march
when
there
was
no
snow
left
on
the
ground
and
the
starlings
were
singing
in
the
hospital
garden
the
doctor
went
out
to
see
his
friend
the
postmaster
as
far
as
the
gate
at
that
very
moment
the
jew
moiseika
returning
with
his
booty
came
into
the
yard
he
had
no
cap
on
and
his
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
goloshes
in
his
hand
he
had
a
little
bag
of
coppers
give
me
a
kopeck
he
said
to
the
doctor
smiling
and
shivering
with
cold
andrey
yefimitch
who
could
never
refuse
anyone
anything
gave
him
a
ten
kopeck
piece
how
bad
that
is
he
thought
looking
at
the
jews
bare
feet
with
their
thin
red
ankles
why
its
wet
and
stirred
by
a
feeling
akin
both
to
pity
and
disgust
he
went
into
the
lodge
behind
the
jew
looking
now
at
his
bald
head
now
at
his
ankles
as
the
doctor
went
in
nikita
jumped
up
from
his
heap
of
litter
and
stood
at
attention
good
day
nikita
andrey
yefimitch
said
mildly
that
jew
should
be
provided
with
boots
or
something
he
will
catch
cold
certainly
your
honour
ill
inform
the
superintendent
please
do
ask
him
in
my
name
tell
him
that
i
asked
the
door
into
the
ward
was
open
ivan
dmitritch
lying
propped
on
his
elbow
on
the
bed
listened
in
alarm
to
the
unfamiliar
voice
and
suddenly
recognized
the
doctor
he
trembled
all
over
with
anger
jumped
up
and
with
a
red
and
wrathful
face
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
ran
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
the
doctor
has
come
he
shouted
and
broke
into
a
laugh
at
last
gentlemen
i
congratulate
you
the
doctor
is
honouring
us
with
a
visit
cursed
reptile
he
shrieked
and
stamped
in
a
frenzy
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
the
ward
before
kill
the
reptile
no
killings
too
good
drown
him
in
the
midden
pit
andrey
yefimitch
hearing
this
looked
into
the
ward
from
the
entry
and
asked
gently
what
for
what
for
shouted
ivan
dmitritch
going
up
to
him
with
a
menacing
air
and
convulsively
wrapping
himself
in
his
dressing
gown
what
for
thief
he
said
with
a
look
of
repulsion
moving
his
lips
as
though
he
would
spit
at
him
quack
hangman
calm
yourself
said
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
guiltily
i
assure
you
i
have
never
stolen
anything
and
as
to
the
rest
most
likely
you
greatly
exaggerate
i
see
you
are
angry
with
me
calm
yourself
i
beg
if
you
can
and
tell
me
coolly
what
are
you
angry
for
what
are
you
keeping
me
here
for
because
you
are
ill
yes
i
am
ill
but
you
know
dozens
hundreds
of
madmen
are
walking
about
in
freedom
because
your
ignorance
is
incapable
of
distinguishing
them
from
the
sane
why
am
i
and
these
poor
wretches
to
be
shut
up
here
like
scapegoats
for
all
the
rest
you
your
assistant
the
superintendent
and
all
your
hospital
rabble
are
immeasurably
inferior
to
every
one
of
us
morally
why
then
are
we
shut
up
and
you
not
wheres
the
logic
of
it
morality
and
logic
dont
come
in
it
all
depends
on
chance
if
anyone
is
shut
up
he
has
to
stay
and
if
anyone
is
not
shut
up
he
can
walk
about
thats
all
there
is
neither
morality
nor
logic
in
my
being
a
doctor
and
your
being
a
mental
patient
there
is
nothing
but
idle
chance
that
twaddle
i
dont
understand
ivan
dmitritch
brought
out
in
a
hollow
voice
and
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
moiseika
whom
nikita
did
not
venture
to
search
in
the
presence
of
the
doctor
laid
out
on
his
bed
pieces
of
bread
bits
of
paper
and
little
bones
and
still
shivering
with
cold
began
rapidly
in
a
singsong
voice
saying
something
in
yiddish
he
most
likely
imagined
that
he
had
opened
a
shop
let
me
out
said
ivan
dmitritch
and
his
voice
quivered
i
cannot
but
why
why
because
it
is
not
in
my
power
think
what
use
will
it
be
to
you
if
i
do
let
you
out
go
the
townspeople
or
the
police
will
detain
you
or
bring
you
back
yes
yes
thats
true
said
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
rubbed
his
forehead
its
awful
but
what
am
i
to
do
what
andrey
yefimitch
liked
ivan
dmitritchs
voice
and
his
intelligent
young
face
with
its
grimaces
he
longed
to
be
kind
to
the
young
man
and
soothe
him
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
him
thought
and
said
you
ask
me
what
to
do
the
very
best
thing
in
your
position
would
be
to
run
away
but
unhappily
that
is
useless
you
would
be
taken
up
when
society
protects
itself
from
the
criminal
mentally
deranged
or
otherwise
inconvenient
people
it
is
invincible
there
is
only
one
thing
left
for
you
to
resign
yourself
to
the
thought
that
your
presence
here
is
inevitable
it
is
no
use
to
anyone
so
long
as
prisons
and
madhouses
exist
someone
must
be
shut
up
in
them
if
not
you
i
if
not
i
some
third
person
wait
till
in
the
distant
future
prisons
and
madhouses
no
longer
exist
and
there
will
be
neither
bars
on
the
windows
nor
hospital
gowns
of
course
that
time
will
come
sooner
or
later
ivan
dmitritch
smiled
ironically
you
are
jesting
he
said
screwing
up
his
eyes
such
gentlemen
as
you
and
your
assistant
nikita
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
future
but
you
may
be
sure
sir
better
days
will
come
i
may
express
myself
cheaply
you
may
laugh
but
the
dawn
of
a
new
life
is
at
hand
truth
and
justice
will
triumph
andour
turn
will
come
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
i
shall
perish
but
some
peoples
great
grandsons
will
see
it
i
greet
them
with
all
my
heart
and
rejoice
rejoice
with
them
onward
god
be
your
help
friends
with
shining
eyes
ivan
dmitritch
got
up
and
stretching
his
hands
towards
the
window
went
on
with
emotion
in
his
voice
from
behind
these
bars
i
bless
you
hurrah
for
truth
and
justice
i
rejoice
i
see
no
particular
reason
to
rejoice
said
andrey
yefimitch
who
thought
ivan
dmitritchs
movement
theatrical
though
he
was
delighted
by
it
prisons
and
madhouses
there
will
not
be
and
truth
as
you
have
just
expressed
it
will
triumph
but
the
reality
of
things
you
know
will
not
change
the
laws
of
nature
will
still
remain
the
same
people
will
suffer
pain
grow
old
and
die
just
as
they
do
now
however
magnificent
a
dawn
lighted
up
your
life
you
would
yet
in
the
end
be
nailed
up
in
a
coffin
and
thrown
into
a
hole
and
immortality
oh
come
now
you
dont
believe
in
it
but
i
do
somebody
in
dostoevsky
or
voltaire
said
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
god
men
would
have
invented
him
and
i
firmly
believe
that
if
there
is
no
immortality
the
great
intellect
of
man
will
sooner
or
later
invent
it
well
said
observed
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
with
pleasure
its
a
good
thing
you
have
faith
with
such
a
belief
one
may
live
happily
even
shut
up
within
walls
you
have
studied
somewhere
i
presume
yes
i
have
been
at
the
university
but
did
not
complete
my
studies
you
are
a
reflecting
and
a
thoughtful
man
in
any
surroundings
you
can
find
tranquillity
in
yourself
free
and
deep
thinking
which
strives
for
the
comprehension
of
life
and
complete
contempt
for
the
foolish
bustle
of
the
worldthose
are
two
blessings
beyond
any
that
man
has
ever
known
and
you
can
possess
them
even
though
you
lived
behind
threefold
bars
diogenes
lived
in
a
tub
yet
he
was
happier
than
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
your
diogenes
was
a
blockhead
said
ivan
dmitritch
morosely
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
diogenes
and
some
foolish
comprehension
of
life
he
cried
growing
suddenly
angry
and
leaping
up
i
love
life
i
love
it
passionately
i
have
the
mania
of
persecution
a
continual
agonizing
terror
but
i
have
moments
when
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
thirst
for
life
and
then
i
am
afraid
of
going
mad
i
want
dreadfully
to
live
dreadfully
he
walked
up
and
down
the
ward
in
agitation
and
said
dropping
his
voice
when
i
dream
i
am
haunted
by
phantoms
people
come
to
me
i
hear
voices
and
music
and
i
fancy
i
am
walking
through
woods
or
by
the
seashore
and
i
long
so
passionately
for
movement
for
interests
come
tell
me
what
news
is
there
asked
ivan
dmitritch
whats
happening
do
you
wish
to
know
about
the
town
or
in
general
well
tell
me
first
about
the
town
and
then
in
general
well
in
the
town
it
is
appallingly
dull
theres
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
no
one
to
listen
to
there
are
no
new
people
a
young
doctor
called
hobotov
has
come
here
recently
he
had
come
in
my
time
well
he
is
a
low
cad
isnt
he
yes
he
is
a
man
of
no
culture
its
strange
you
know
judging
by
every
sign
there
is
no
intellectual
stagnation
in
our
capital
cities
there
is
a
movementso
there
must
be
real
people
there
too
but
for
some
reason
they
always
send
us
such
men
as
i
would
rather
not
see
its
an
unlucky
town
yes
it
is
an
unlucky
town
sighed
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
laughed
and
how
are
things
in
general
what
are
they
writing
in
the
papers
and
reviews
it
was
by
now
dark
in
the
ward
the
doctor
got
up
and
standing
began
to
describe
what
was
being
written
abroad
and
in
russia
and
the
tendency
of
thought
that
could
be
noticed
now
ivan
dmitritch
listened
attentively
and
put
questions
but
suddenly
as
though
recalling
something
terrible
clutched
at
his
head
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
with
his
back
to
the
doctor
whats
the
matter
asked
andrey
yefimitch
you
will
not
hear
another
word
from
me
said
ivan
dmitritch
rudely
leave
me
alone
why
so
i
tell
you
leave
me
alone
why
the
devil
do
you
persist
andrey
yefimitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
heaved
a
sigh
and
went
out
as
he
crossed
the
entry
he
said
you
might
clear
up
here
nikita
theres
an
awfully
stuffy
smell
certainly
your
honour
what
an
agreeable
young
man
thought
andrey
yefimitch
going
back
to
his
flat
in
all
the
years
i
have
been
living
here
i
do
believe
he
is
the
first
i
have
met
with
whom
one
can
talk
he
is
capable
of
reasoning
and
is
interested
in
just
the
right
things
while
he
was
reading
and
afterwards
while
he
was
going
to
bed
he
kept
thinking
about
ivan
dmitritch
and
when
he
woke
next
morning
he
remembered
that
he
had
the
day
before
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
intelligent
and
interesting
man
and
determined
to
visit
him
again
as
soon
as
possible
x
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
in
the
same
position
as
on
the
previous
day
with
his
head
clutched
in
both
hands
and
his
legs
drawn
up
his
face
was
not
visible
good
day
my
friend
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
are
not
asleep
are
you
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
your
friend
ivan
dmitritch
articulated
into
the
pillow
and
in
the
second
your
efforts
are
useless
you
will
not
get
one
word
out
of
me
strange
muttered
andrey
yefimitch
in
confusion
yesterday
we
talked
peacefully
but
suddenly
for
some
reason
you
took
offence
and
broke
off
all
at
once
probably
i
expressed
myself
awkwardly
or
perhaps
gave
utterance
to
some
idea
which
did
not
fit
in
with
your
convictions
yes
a
likely
idea
said
ivan
dmitritch
sitting
up
and
looking
at
the
doctor
with
irony
and
uneasiness
his
eyes
were
red
you
can
go
and
spy
and
probe
somewhere
else
its
no
use
your
doing
it
here
i
knew
yesterday
what
you
had
come
for
a
strange
fancy
laughed
the
doctor
so
you
suppose
me
to
be
a
spy
yes
i
do
a
spy
or
a
doctor
who
has
been
charged
to
test
meits
all
the
same
oh
excuse
me
what
a
queer
fellow
you
are
really
the
doctor
sat
down
on
the
stool
near
the
bed
and
shook
his
head
reproachfully
but
let
us
suppose
you
are
right
he
said
let
us
suppose
that
i
am
treacherously
trying
to
trap
you
into
saying
something
so
as
to
betray
you
to
the
police
you
would
be
arrested
and
then
tried
but
would
you
be
any
worse
off
being
tried
and
in
prison
than
you
are
here
if
you
are
banished
to
a
settlement
or
even
sent
to
penal
servitude
would
it
be
worse
than
being
shut
up
in
this
ward
i
imagine
it
would
be
no
worse
what
then
are
you
afraid
of
these
words
evidently
had
an
effect
on
ivan
dmitritch
he
sat
down
quietly
it
was
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoonthe
time
when
andrey
yefimitch
usually
walked
up
and
down
his
rooms
and
daryushka
asked
whether
it
was
not
time
for
his
beer
it
was
a
still
bright
day
i
came
out
for
a
walk
after
dinner
and
here
i
have
come
as
you
see
said
the
doctor
it
is
quite
spring
what
month
is
it
march
asked
ivan
dmitritch
yes
the
end
of
march
is
it
very
muddy
no
not
very
there
are
already
paths
in
the
garden
it
would
be
nice
now
to
drive
in
an
open
carriage
somewhere
into
the
country
said
ivan
dmitritch
rubbing
his
red
eyes
as
though
he
were
just
awake
then
to
come
home
to
a
warm
snug
study
and
and
to
have
a
decent
doctor
to
cure
ones
headache
its
so
long
since
i
have
lived
like
a
human
being
its
disgusting
here
insufferably
disgusting
after
his
excitement
of
the
previous
day
he
was
exhausted
and
listless
and
spoke
unwillingly
his
fingers
twitched
and
from
his
face
it
could
be
seen
that
he
had
a
splitting
headache
there
is
no
real
difference
between
a
warm
snug
study
and
this
ward
said
andrey
yefimitch
a
mans
peace
and
contentment
do
not
lie
outside
a
man
but
in
himself
what
do
you
mean
the
ordinary
man
looks
for
good
and
evil
in
external
thingsthat
is
in
carriages
in
studiesbut
a
thinking
man
looks
for
it
in
himself
you
should
go
and
preach
that
philosophy
in
greece
where
its
warm
and
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
pomegranates
but
here
it
is
not
suited
to
the
climate
with
whom
was
it
i
was
talking
of
diogenes
was
it
with
you
yes
with
me
yesterday
diogenes
did
not
need
a
study
or
a
warm
habitation
its
hot
there
without
you
can
lie
in
your
tub
and
eat
oranges
and
olives
but
bring
him
to
russia
to
live
hed
be
begging
to
be
let
indoors
in
may
let
alone
december
hed
be
doubled
up
with
the
cold
no
one
can
be
insensible
to
cold
as
to
every
other
pain
marcus
aurelius
says
a
pain
is
a
vivid
idea
of
pain
make
an
effort
of
will
to
change
that
idea
dismiss
it
cease
to
complain
and
the
pain
will
disappear
that
is
true
the
wise
man
or
simply
the
reflecting
thoughtful
man
is
distinguished
precisely
by
his
contempt
for
suffering
he
is
always
contented
and
surprised
at
nothing
then
i
am
an
idiot
since
i
suffer
and
am
discontented
and
surprised
at
the
baseness
of
mankind
you
are
wrong
in
that
if
you
will
reflect
more
on
the
subject
you
will
understand
how
insignificant
is
all
that
external
world
that
agitates
us
one
must
strive
for
the
comprehension
of
life
and
in
that
is
true
happiness
comprehension
repeated
ivan
dmitritch
frowning
external
internal
excuse
me
but
i
dont
understand
it
i
only
know
he
said
getting
up
and
looking
angrily
at
the
doctori
only
know
that
god
has
created
me
of
warm
blood
and
nerves
yes
indeed
if
organic
tissue
is
capable
of
life
it
must
react
to
every
stimulus
and
i
do
to
pain
i
respond
with
tears
and
outcries
to
baseness
with
indignation
to
filth
with
loathing
to
my
mind
that
is
just
what
is
called
life
the
lower
the
organism
the
less
sensitive
it
is
and
the
more
feebly
it
reacts
to
stimulus
and
the
higher
it
is
the
more
responsively
and
vigorously
it
reacts
to
reality
how
is
it
you
dont
know
that
a
doctor
and
not
know
such
trifles
to
despise
suffering
to
be
always
contented
and
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
one
must
reach
this
conditionand
ivan
dmitritch
pointed
to
the
peasant
who
was
a
mass
of
fator
to
harden
oneself
by
suffering
to
such
a
point
that
one
loses
all
sensibility
to
itthat
is
in
other
words
to
cease
to
live
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
not
a
sage
or
a
philosopher
ivan
dmitritch
continued
with
irritation
and
i
dont
understand
anything
about
it
i
am
not
capable
of
reasoning
on
the
contrary
your
reasoning
is
excellent
the
stoics
whom
you
are
parodying
were
remarkable
people
but
their
doctrine
crystallized
two
thousand
years
ago
and
has
not
advanced
and
will
not
advance
an
inch
forward
since
it
is
not
practical
or
living
it
had
a
success
only
with
the
minority
which
spends
its
life
in
savouring
all
sorts
of
theories
and
ruminating
over
them
the
majority
did
not
understand
it
a
doctrine
which
advocates
indifference
to
wealth
and
to
the
comforts
of
life
and
a
contempt
for
suffering
and
death
is
quite
unintelligible
to
the
vast
majority
of
men
since
that
majority
has
never
known
wealth
or
the
comforts
of
life
and
to
despise
suffering
would
mean
to
it
despising
life
itself
since
the
whole
existence
of
man
is
made
up
of
the
sensations
of
hunger
cold
injury
and
a
hamlet
like
dread
of
death
the
whole
of
life
lies
in
these
sensations
one
may
be
oppressed
by
it
one
may
hate
it
but
one
cannot
despise
it
yes
so
i
repeat
the
doctrine
of
the
stoics
can
never
have
a
future
from
the
beginning
of
time
up
to
to
day
you
see
continually
increasing
the
struggle
the
sensibility
to
pain
the
capacity
of
responding
to
stimulus
ivan
dmitritch
suddenly
lost
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
stopped
and
rubbed
his
forehead
with
vexation
i
meant
to
say
something
important
but
i
have
lost
it
he
said
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
this
is
what
i
mean
one
of
the
stoics
sold
himself
into
slavery
to
redeem
his
neighbour
so
you
see
even
a
stoic
did
react
to
stimulus
since
for
such
a
generous
act
as
the
destruction
of
oneself
for
the
sake
of
ones
neighbour
he
must
have
had
a
soul
capable
of
pity
and
indignation
here
in
prison
i
have
forgotten
everything
i
have
learned
or
else
i
could
have
recalled
something
else
take
christ
for
instance
christ
responded
to
reality
by
weeping
smiling
being
sorrowful
and
moved
to
wrath
even
overcome
by
misery
he
did
not
go
to
meet
his
sufferings
with
a
smile
he
did
not
despise
death
but
prayed
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
that
this
cup
might
pass
him
by
ivan
dmitritch
laughed
and
sat
down
granted
that
a
mans
peace
and
contentment
lie
not
outside
but
in
himself
he
said
granted
that
one
must
despise
suffering
and
not
be
surprised
at
anything
yet
on
what
ground
do
you
preach
the
theory
are
you
a
sage
a
philosopher
no
i
am
not
a
philosopher
but
everyone
ought
to
preach
it
because
it
is
reasonable
no
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
consider
yourself
competent
to
judge
of
comprehension
contempt
for
suffering
and
so
on
have
you
ever
suffered
have
you
any
idea
of
suffering
allow
me
to
ask
you
were
you
ever
thrashed
in
your
childhood
no
my
parents
had
an
aversion
for
corporal
punishment
my
father
used
to
flog
me
cruelly
my
father
was
a
harsh
sickly
government
clerk
with
a
long
nose
and
a
yellow
neck
but
let
us
talk
of
you
no
one
has
laid
a
finger
on
you
all
your
life
no
one
has
scared
you
nor
beaten
you
you
are
as
strong
as
a
bull
you
grew
up
under
your
fathers
wing
and
studied
at
his
expense
and
then
you
dropped
at
once
into
a
sinecure
for
more
than
twenty
years
you
have
lived
rent
free
with
heating
lighting
and
service
all
provided
and
had
the
right
to
work
how
you
pleased
and
as
much
as
you
pleased
even
to
do
nothing
you
were
naturally
a
flabby
lazy
man
and
so
you
have
tried
to
arrange
your
life
so
that
nothing
should
disturb
you
or
make
you
move
you
have
handed
over
your
work
to
the
assistant
and
the
rest
of
the
rabble
while
you
sit
in
peace
and
warmth
save
money
read
amuse
yourself
with
reflections
with
all
sorts
of
lofty
nonsense
and
ivan
dmitritch
looked
at
the
doctors
red
nose
with
boozing
in
fact
you
have
seen
nothing
of
life
you
know
absolutely
nothing
of
it
and
are
only
theoretically
acquainted
with
reality
you
despise
suffering
and
are
surprised
at
nothing
for
a
very
simple
reason
vanity
of
vanities
the
external
and
the
internal
contempt
for
life
for
suffering
and
for
death
comprehension
true
happinessthats
the
philosophy
that
suits
the
russian
sluggard
best
you
see
a
peasant
beating
his
wife
for
instance
why
interfere
let
him
beat
her
they
will
both
die
sooner
or
later
anyway
and
besides
he
who
beats
injures
by
his
blows
not
the
person
he
is
beating
but
himself
to
get
drunk
is
stupid
and
unseemly
but
if
you
drink
you
die
and
if
you
dont
drink
you
die
a
peasant
woman
comes
with
toothache
well
what
of
it
pain
is
the
idea
of
pain
and
besides
there
is
no
living
in
this
world
without
illness
we
shall
all
die
and
so
go
away
woman
dont
hinder
me
from
thinking
and
drinking
vodka
a
young
man
asks
advice
what
he
is
to
do
how
he
is
to
live
anyone
else
would
think
before
answering
but
you
have
got
the
answer
ready
strive
for
comprehension
or
for
true
happiness
and
what
is
that
fantastic
true
happiness
theres
no
answer
of
course
we
are
kept
here
behind
barred
windows
tortured
left
to
rot
but
that
is
very
good
and
reasonable
because
there
is
no
difference
at
all
between
this
ward
and
a
warm
snug
study
a
convenient
philosophy
you
can
do
nothing
and
your
conscience
is
clear
and
you
feel
you
are
wise
no
sir
it
is
not
philosophy
its
not
thinking
its
not
breadth
of
vision
but
laziness
fakirism
drowsy
stupefaction
yes
cried
ivan
dmitritch
getting
angry
again
you
despise
suffering
but
ill
be
bound
if
you
pinch
your
finger
in
the
door
you
will
howl
at
the
top
of
your
voice
and
perhaps
i
shouldnt
howl
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
a
gentle
smile
oh
i
dare
say
well
if
you
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
or
supposing
some
fool
or
bully
took
advantage
of
his
position
and
rank
to
insult
you
in
public
and
if
you
knew
he
could
do
it
with
impunity
then
you
would
understand
what
it
means
to
put
people
off
with
comprehension
and
true
happiness
thats
original
said
andrey
yefimitch
laughing
with
pleasure
and
rubbing
his
hands
i
am
agreeably
struck
by
your
inclination
for
drawing
generalizations
and
the
sketch
of
my
character
you
have
just
drawn
is
simply
brilliant
i
must
confess
that
talking
to
you
gives
me
great
pleasure
well
ive
listened
to
you
and
now
you
must
graciously
listen
to
me
xi
the
conversation
went
on
for
about
an
hour
longer
and
apparently
made
a
deep
impression
on
andrey
yefimitch
he
began
going
to
the
ward
every
day
he
went
there
in
the
mornings
and
after
dinner
and
often
the
dusk
of
evening
found
him
in
conversation
with
ivan
dmitritch
at
first
ivan
dmitritch
held
aloof
from
him
suspected
him
of
evil
designs
and
openly
expressed
his
hostility
but
afterwards
he
got
used
to
him
and
his
abrupt
manner
changed
to
one
of
condescending
irony
soon
it
was
all
over
the
hospital
that
the
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
had
taken
to
visiting
ward
no
no
oneneither
sergey
sergevitch
nor
nikita
nor
the
nursescould
conceive
why
he
went
there
why
he
stayed
there
for
hours
together
what
he
was
talking
about
and
why
he
did
not
write
prescriptions
his
actions
seemed
strange
often
mihail
averyanitch
did
not
find
him
at
home
which
had
never
happened
in
the
past
and
daryushka
was
greatly
perturbed
for
the
doctor
drank
his
beer
now
at
no
definite
time
and
sometimes
was
even
late
for
dinner
one
dayit
was
at
the
end
of
junedr
hobotov
went
to
see
andrey
yefimitch
about
something
not
finding
him
at
home
he
proceeded
to
look
for
him
in
the
yard
there
he
was
told
that
the
old
doctor
had
gone
to
see
the
mental
patients
going
into
the
lodge
and
stopping
in
the
entry
hobotov
heard
the
following
conversation
we
shall
never
agree
and
you
will
not
succeed
in
converting
me
to
your
faith
ivan
dmitritch
was
saying
irritably
you
are
utterly
ignorant
of
reality
and
you
have
never
known
suffering
but
have
only
like
a
leech
fed
beside
the
sufferings
of
others
while
i
have
been
in
continual
suffering
from
the
day
of
my
birth
till
to
day
for
that
reason
i
tell
you
frankly
i
consider
myself
superior
to
you
and
more
competent
in
every
respect
its
not
for
you
to
teach
me
i
have
absolutely
no
ambition
to
convert
you
to
my
faith
said
andrey
yefimitch
gently
and
with
regret
that
the
other
refused
to
understand
him
and
that
is
not
what
matters
my
friend
what
matters
is
not
that
you
have
suffered
and
i
have
not
joy
and
suffering
are
passing
let
us
leave
them
never
mind
them
what
matters
is
that
you
and
i
think
we
see
in
each
other
people
who
are
capable
of
thinking
and
reasoning
and
that
is
a
common
bond
between
us
however
different
our
views
if
you
knew
my
friend
how
sick
i
am
of
the
universal
senselessness
ineptitude
stupidity
and
with
what
delight
i
always
talk
with
you
you
are
an
intelligent
man
and
i
enjoyed
your
company
hobotov
opened
the
door
an
inch
and
glanced
into
the
ward
ivan
dmitritch
in
his
night
cap
and
the
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
bed
the
madman
was
grimacing
twitching
and
convulsively
wrapping
himself
in
his
gown
while
the
doctor
sat
motionless
with
bowed
head
and
his
face
was
red
and
look
helpless
and
sorrowful
hobotov
shrugged
his
shoulders
grinned
and
glanced
at
nikita
nikita
shrugged
his
shoulders
too
next
day
hobotov
went
to
the
lodge
accompanied
by
the
assistant
both
stood
in
the
entry
and
listened
i
fancy
our
old
man
has
gone
clean
off
his
chump
said
hobotov
as
he
came
out
of
the
lodge
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
sinners
sighed
the
decorous
sergey
sergeyitch
scrupulously
avoiding
the
puddles
that
he
might
not
muddy
his
polished
boots
i
must
own
honoured
yevgeny
fyodoritch
i
have
been
expecting
it
for
a
long
time
xii
after
this
andrey
yefimitch
began
to
notice
a
mysterious
air
in
all
around
him
the
attendants
the
nurses
and
the
patients
looked
at
him
inquisitively
when
they
met
him
and
then
whispered
together
the
superintendents
little
daughter
masha
whom
he
liked
to
meet
in
the
hospital
garden
for
some
reason
ran
away
from
him
now
when
he
went
up
with
a
smile
to
stroke
her
on
the
head
the
postmaster
no
longer
said
perfectly
true
as
he
listened
to
him
but
in
unaccountable
confusion
muttered
yes
yes
yes
and
looked
at
him
with
a
grieved
and
thoughtful
expression
for
some
reason
he
took
to
advising
his
friend
to
give
up
vodka
and
beer
but
as
a
man
of
delicate
feeling
he
did
not
say
this
directly
but
hinted
it
telling
him
first
about
the
commanding
officer
of
his
battalion
an
excellent
man
and
then
about
the
priest
of
the
regiment
a
capital
fellow
both
of
whom
drank
and
fell
ill
but
on
giving
up
drinking
completely
regained
their
health
on
two
or
three
occasions
andrey
yefimitch
was
visited
by
his
colleague
hobotov
who
also
advised
him
to
give
up
spirituous
liquors
and
for
no
apparent
reason
recommended
him
to
take
bromide
in
august
andrey
yefimitch
got
a
letter
from
the
mayor
of
the
town
asking
him
to
come
on
very
important
business
on
arriving
at
the
town
hall
at
the
time
fixed
andrey
yefimitch
found
there
the
military
commander
the
superintendent
of
the
district
school
a
member
of
the
town
council
hobotov
and
a
plump
fair
gentleman
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
a
doctor
this
doctor
with
a
polish
surname
difficult
to
pronounce
lived
at
a
pedigree
stud
farm
twenty
miles
away
and
was
now
on
a
visit
to
the
town
theres
something
that
concerns
you
said
the
member
of
the
town
council
addressing
andrey
yefimitch
after
they
had
all
greeted
one
another
and
sat
down
to
the
table
here
yevgeny
fyodoritch
says
that
there
is
not
room
for
the
dispensary
in
the
main
building
and
that
it
ought
to
be
transferred
to
one
of
the
lodges
thats
of
no
consequenceof
course
it
can
be
transferred
but
the
point
is
that
the
lodge
wants
doing
up
yes
it
would
have
to
be
done
up
said
andrey
yefimitch
after
a
moments
thought
if
the
corner
lodge
for
instance
were
fitted
up
as
a
dispensary
i
imagine
it
would
cost
at
least
five
hundred
roubles
an
unproductive
expenditure
everyone
was
silent
for
a
space
i
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
ten
years
ago
andrey
yefimitch
went
on
in
a
low
voice
that
the
hospital
in
its
present
form
is
a
luxury
for
the
town
beyond
its
means
it
was
built
in
the
forties
but
things
were
different
then
the
town
spends
too
much
on
unnecessary
buildings
and
superfluous
staff
i
believe
with
a
different
system
two
model
hospitals
might
be
maintained
for
the
same
money
well
let
us
have
a
different
system
then
the
member
of
the
town
council
said
briskly
i
have
already
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
that
the
medical
department
should
be
transferred
to
the
supervision
of
the
zemstvo
yes
transfer
the
money
to
the
zemstvo
and
they
will
steal
it
laughed
the
fair
haired
doctor
thats
what
it
always
comes
to
the
member
of
the
council
assented
and
he
also
laughed
andrey
yefimitch
looked
with
apathetic
lustreless
eyes
at
the
fair
haired
doctor
and
said
one
should
be
just
again
there
was
silence
tea
was
brought
in
the
military
commander
for
some
reason
much
embarrassed
touched
andrey
yefimitchs
hand
across
the
table
and
said
you
have
quite
forgotten
us
doctor
but
of
course
you
are
a
hermit
you
dont
play
cards
and
dont
like
women
you
would
be
dull
with
fellows
like
us
they
all
began
saying
how
boring
it
was
for
a
decent
person
to
live
in
such
a
town
no
theatre
no
music
and
at
the
last
dance
at
the
club
there
had
been
about
twenty
ladies
and
only
two
gentlemen
the
young
men
did
not
dance
but
spent
all
the
time
crowding
round
the
refreshment
bar
or
playing
cards
not
looking
at
anyone
and
speaking
slowly
in
a
low
voice
andrey
yefimitch
began
saying
what
a
pity
what
a
terrible
pity
it
was
that
the
townspeople
should
waste
their
vital
energy
their
hearts
and
their
minds
on
cards
and
gossip
and
should
have
neither
the
power
nor
the
inclination
to
spend
their
time
in
interesting
conversation
and
reading
and
should
refuse
to
take
advantage
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
mind
the
mind
alone
was
interesting
and
worthy
of
attention
all
the
rest
was
low
and
petty
hobotov
listened
to
his
colleague
attentively
and
suddenly
asked
andrey
yefimitch
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
having
received
an
answer
the
fair
haired
doctor
and
he
in
the
tone
of
examiners
conscious
of
their
lack
of
skill
began
asking
andrey
yefimitch
what
was
the
day
of
the
week
how
many
days
there
were
in
the
year
and
whether
it
was
true
that
there
was
a
remarkable
prophet
living
in
ward
no
in
response
to
the
last
question
andrey
yefimitch
turned
rather
red
and
said
yes
he
is
mentally
deranged
but
he
is
an
interesting
young
man
they
asked
him
no
other
questions
when
he
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
in
the
entry
the
military
commander
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
with
a
sigh
its
time
for
us
old
fellows
to
rest
as
he
came
out
of
the
hall
andrey
yefimitch
understood
that
it
had
been
a
committee
appointed
to
enquire
into
his
mental
condition
he
recalled
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
him
flushed
crimson
and
for
some
reason
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
felt
bitterly
grieved
for
medical
science
my
god
he
thought
remembering
how
these
doctors
had
just
examined
him
why
they
have
only
lately
been
hearing
lectures
on
mental
pathology
they
had
passed
an
examinationwhats
the
explanation
of
this
crass
ignorance
they
have
not
a
conception
of
mental
pathology
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
insulted
and
moved
to
anger
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
mihail
averyanitch
came
to
see
him
the
postmaster
went
up
to
him
without
waiting
to
greet
him
took
him
by
both
hands
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
my
dear
fellow
my
dear
friend
show
me
that
you
believe
in
my
genuine
affection
and
look
on
me
as
your
friend
and
preventing
andrey
yefimitch
from
speaking
he
went
on
growing
excited
i
love
you
for
your
culture
and
nobility
of
soul
listen
to
me
my
dear
fellow
the
rules
of
their
profession
compel
the
doctors
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
but
i
blurt
out
the
plain
truth
like
a
soldier
you
are
not
well
excuse
me
my
dear
fellow
but
it
is
the
truth
everyone
about
you
has
been
noticing
it
for
a
long
time
dr
yevgeny
fyodoritch
has
just
told
me
that
it
is
essential
for
you
to
rest
and
distract
your
mind
for
the
sake
of
your
health
perfectly
true
excellent
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
taking
a
holiday
and
am
going
away
for
a
sniff
of
a
different
atmosphere
show
that
you
are
a
friend
to
me
let
us
go
together
let
us
go
for
a
jaunt
as
in
the
good
old
days
i
feel
perfectly
well
said
andrey
yefimitch
after
a
moments
thought
i
cant
go
away
allow
me
to
show
you
my
friendship
in
some
other
way
to
go
off
with
no
object
without
his
books
without
his
daryushka
without
his
beer
to
break
abruptly
through
the
routine
of
life
established
for
twenty
yearsthe
idea
for
the
first
minute
struck
him
as
wild
and
fantastic
but
he
remembered
the
conversation
at
the
zemstvo
committee
and
the
depressing
feelings
with
which
he
had
returned
home
and
the
thought
of
a
brief
absence
from
the
town
in
which
stupid
people
looked
on
him
as
a
madman
was
pleasant
to
him
and
where
precisely
do
you
intend
to
go
he
asked
to
moscow
to
petersburg
to
warsaw
i
spent
the
five
happiest
years
of
my
life
in
warsaw
what
a
marvellous
town
let
us
go
my
dear
fellow
xiii
a
week
later
it
was
suggested
to
andrey
yefimitch
that
he
should
have
a
restthat
is
send
in
his
resignationa
suggestion
he
received
with
indifference
and
a
week
later
still
mihail
averyanitch
and
he
were
sitting
in
a
posting
carriage
driving
to
the
nearest
railway
station
the
days
were
cool
and
bright
with
a
blue
sky
and
a
transparent
distance
they
were
two
days
driving
the
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
railway
station
and
stayed
two
nights
on
the
way
when
at
the
posting
station
the
glasses
given
them
for
their
tea
had
not
been
properly
washed
or
the
drivers
were
slow
in
harnessing
the
horses
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
and
quivering
all
over
would
shout
hold
your
tongue
dont
argue
and
in
the
carriage
he
talked
without
ceasing
for
a
moment
describing
his
campaigns
in
the
caucasus
and
in
poland
what
adventures
he
had
had
what
meetings
he
talked
loudly
and
opened
his
eyes
so
wide
with
wonder
that
he
might
well
be
thought
to
be
lying
moreover
as
he
talked
he
breathed
in
andrey
yefimitchs
face
and
laughed
into
his
ear
this
bothered
the
doctor
and
prevented
him
from
thinking
or
concentrating
his
mind
in
the
train
they
travelled
from
motives
of
economy
third
class
in
a
non
smoking
compartment
half
the
passengers
were
decent
people
mihail
averyanitch
soon
made
friends
with
everyone
and
moving
from
one
seat
to
another
kept
saying
loudly
that
they
ought
not
to
travel
by
these
appalling
lines
it
was
a
regular
swindle
a
very
different
thing
riding
on
a
good
horse
one
could
do
over
seventy
miles
a
day
and
feel
fresh
and
well
after
it
and
our
bad
harvests
were
due
to
the
draining
of
the
pinsk
marshes
altogether
the
way
things
were
done
was
dreadful
he
got
excited
talked
loudly
and
would
not
let
others
speak
this
endless
chatter
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
laughter
and
expressive
gestures
wearied
andrey
yefimitch
which
of
us
is
the
madman
he
thought
with
vexation
i
who
try
not
to
disturb
my
fellow
passengers
in
any
way
or
this
egoist
who
thinks
that
he
is
cleverer
and
more
interesting
than
anyone
here
and
so
will
leave
no
one
in
peace
in
moscow
mihail
averyanitch
put
on
a
military
coat
without
epaulettes
and
trousers
with
red
braid
on
them
he
wore
a
military
cap
and
overcoat
in
the
street
and
soldiers
saluted
him
it
seemed
to
andrey
yefimitch
now
that
his
companion
was
a
man
who
had
flung
away
all
that
was
good
and
kept
only
what
was
bad
of
all
the
characteristics
of
a
country
gentleman
that
he
had
once
possessed
he
liked
to
be
waited
on
even
when
it
was
quite
unnecessary
the
matches
would
be
lying
before
him
on
the
table
and
he
would
see
them
and
shout
to
the
waiter
to
give
him
the
matches
he
did
not
hesitate
to
appear
before
a
maidservant
in
nothing
but
his
underclothes
he
used
the
familiar
mode
of
address
to
all
footmen
indiscriminately
even
old
men
and
when
he
was
angry
called
them
fools
and
blockheads
this
andrey
yefimitch
thought
was
like
a
gentleman
but
disgusting
first
of
all
mihail
averyanitch
led
his
friend
to
the
iversky
madonna
he
prayed
fervently
shedding
tears
and
bowing
down
to
the
earth
and
when
he
had
finished
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
even
though
one
does
not
believe
it
makes
one
somehow
easier
when
one
prays
a
little
kiss
the
ikon
my
dear
fellow
andrey
yefimitch
was
embarrassed
and
he
kissed
the
image
while
mihail
averyanitch
pursed
up
his
lips
and
prayed
in
a
whisper
and
again
tears
came
into
his
eyes
then
they
went
to
the
kremlin
and
looked
there
at
the
tsar
cannon
and
the
tsar
bell
and
even
touched
them
with
their
fingers
admired
the
view
over
the
river
visited
st
saviours
and
the
rumyantsev
museum
they
dined
at
tyestovs
mihail
averyanitch
looked
a
long
time
at
the
menu
stroking
his
whiskers
and
said
in
the
tone
of
a
gourmand
accustomed
to
dine
in
restaurants
we
shall
see
what
you
give
us
to
eat
to
day
angel
xiv
the
doctor
walked
about
looked
at
things
ate
and
drank
but
he
had
all
the
while
one
feeling
annoyance
with
mihail
averyanitch
he
longed
to
have
a
rest
from
his
friend
to
get
away
from
him
to
hide
himself
while
the
friend
thought
it
was
his
duty
not
to
let
the
doctor
move
a
step
away
from
him
and
to
provide
him
with
as
many
distractions
as
possible
when
there
was
nothing
to
look
at
he
entertained
him
with
conversation
for
two
days
andrey
yefimitch
endured
it
but
on
the
third
he
announced
to
his
friend
that
he
was
ill
and
wanted
to
stay
at
home
for
the
whole
day
his
friend
replied
that
in
that
case
he
would
stay
toothat
really
he
needed
rest
for
he
was
run
off
his
legs
already
andrey
yefimitch
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
back
and
clenching
his
teeth
listened
to
his
friend
who
assured
him
with
heat
that
sooner
or
later
france
would
certainly
thrash
germany
that
there
were
a
great
many
scoundrels
in
moscow
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
judge
of
a
horses
quality
by
its
outward
appearance
the
doctor
began
to
have
a
buzzing
in
his
ears
and
palpitations
of
the
heart
but
out
of
delicacy
could
not
bring
himself
to
beg
his
friend
to
go
away
or
hold
his
tongue
fortunately
mihail
averyanitch
grew
weary
of
sitting
in
the
hotel
room
and
after
dinner
he
went
out
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
andrey
yefimitch
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
relief
how
pleasant
to
lie
motionless
on
the
sofa
and
to
know
that
one
is
alone
in
the
room
real
happiness
is
impossible
without
solitude
the
fallen
angel
betrayed
god
probably
because
he
longed
for
solitude
of
which
the
angels
know
nothing
andrey
yefimitch
wanted
to
think
about
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
during
the
last
few
days
but
he
could
not
get
mihail
averyanitch
out
of
his
head
why
he
has
taken
a
holiday
and
come
with
me
out
of
friendship
out
of
generosity
thought
the
doctor
with
vexation
nothing
could
be
worse
than
this
friendly
supervision
i
suppose
he
is
good
natured
and
generous
and
a
lively
fellow
but
he
is
a
bore
an
insufferable
bore
in
the
same
way
there
are
people
who
never
say
anything
but
what
is
clever
and
good
yet
one
feels
that
they
are
dull
witted
people
for
the
following
days
andrey
yefimitch
declared
himself
ill
and
would
not
leave
the
hotel
room
he
lay
with
his
face
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
suffered
agonies
of
weariness
when
his
friend
entertained
him
with
conversation
or
rested
when
his
friend
was
absent
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
come
and
with
his
friend
who
grew
every
day
more
talkative
and
more
free
and
easy
he
could
not
succeed
in
attuning
his
thoughts
to
a
serious
and
lofty
level
this
is
what
i
get
from
the
real
life
ivan
dmitritch
talked
about
he
thought
angry
at
his
own
pettiness
its
of
no
consequence
though
i
shall
go
home
and
everything
will
go
on
as
before
it
was
the
same
thing
in
petersburg
too
for
whole
days
together
he
did
not
leave
the
hotel
room
but
lay
on
the
sofa
and
only
got
up
to
drink
beer
mihail
averyanitch
was
all
haste
to
get
to
warsaw
my
dear
man
what
should
i
go
there
for
said
andrey
yefimitch
in
an
imploring
voice
you
go
alone
and
let
me
get
home
i
entreat
you
on
no
account
protested
mihail
averyanitch
its
a
marvellous
town
andrey
yefimitch
had
not
the
strength
of
will
to
insist
on
his
own
way
and
much
against
his
inclination
went
to
warsaw
there
he
did
not
leave
the
hotel
room
but
lay
on
the
sofa
furious
with
himself
with
his
friend
and
with
the
waiters
who
obstinately
refused
to
understand
russian
while
mihail
averyanitch
healthy
hearty
and
full
of
spirits
as
usual
went
about
the
town
from
morning
to
night
looking
for
his
old
acquaintances
several
times
he
did
not
return
home
at
night
after
one
night
spent
in
some
unknown
haunt
he
returned
home
early
in
the
morning
in
a
violently
excited
condition
with
a
red
face
and
tousled
hair
for
a
long
time
he
walked
up
and
down
the
rooms
muttering
something
to
himself
then
stopped
and
said
honour
before
everything
after
walking
up
and
down
a
little
longer
he
clutched
his
head
in
both
hands
and
pronounced
in
a
tragic
voice
yes
honour
before
everything
accursed
be
the
moment
when
the
idea
first
entered
my
head
to
visit
this
babylon
my
dear
friend
he
added
addressing
the
doctor
you
may
despise
me
i
have
played
and
lost
lend
me
five
hundred
roubles
andrey
yefimitch
counted
out
five
hundred
roubles
and
gave
them
to
his
friend
without
a
word
the
latter
still
crimson
with
shame
and
anger
incoherently
articulated
some
useless
vow
put
on
his
cap
and
went
out
returning
two
hours
later
he
flopped
into
an
easy
chair
heaved
a
loud
sigh
and
said
my
honour
is
saved
let
us
go
my
friend
i
do
not
care
to
remain
another
hour
in
this
accursed
town
scoundrels
austrian
spies
by
the
time
the
friends
were
back
in
their
own
town
it
was
november
and
deep
snow
was
lying
in
the
streets
dr
hobotov
had
andrey
yefimitchs
post
he
was
still
living
in
his
old
lodgings
waiting
for
andrey
yefimitch
to
arrive
and
clear
out
of
the
hospital
apartments
the
plain
woman
whom
he
called
his
cook
was
already
established
in
one
of
the
lodges
fresh
scandals
about
the
hospital
were
going
the
round
of
the
town
it
was
said
that
the
plain
woman
had
quarrelled
with
the
superintendent
and
that
the
latter
had
crawled
on
his
knees
before
her
begging
forgiveness
on
the
very
first
day
he
arrived
andrey
yefimitch
had
to
look
out
for
lodgings
my
friend
the
postmaster
said
to
him
timidly
excuse
an
indiscreet
question
what
means
have
you
at
your
disposal
andrey
yefimitch
without
a
word
counted
out
his
money
and
said
eighty
six
roubles
i
dont
mean
that
mihail
averyanitch
brought
out
in
confusion
misunderstanding
him
i
mean
what
have
you
to
live
on
i
tell
you
eighty
six
roubles
i
have
nothing
else
mihail
averyanitch
looked
upon
the
doctor
as
an
honourable
man
yet
he
suspected
that
he
had
accumulated
a
fortune
of
at
least
twenty
thousand
now
learning
that
andrey
yefimitch
was
a
beggar
that
he
had
nothing
to
live
on
he
was
for
some
reason
suddenly
moved
to
tears
and
embraced
his
friend
xv
andrey
yefimitch
now
lodged
in
a
little
house
with
three
windows
there
were
only
three
rooms
besides
the
kitchen
in
the
little
house
the
doctor
lived
in
two
of
them
which
looked
into
the
street
while
daryushka
and
the
landlady
with
her
three
children
lived
in
the
third
room
and
the
kitchen
sometimes
the
landladys
lover
a
drunken
peasant
who
was
rowdy
and
reduced
the
children
and
daryushka
to
terror
would
come
for
the
night
when
he
arrived
and
established
himself
in
the
kitchen
and
demanded
vodka
they
all
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
the
doctor
would
be
moved
by
pity
to
take
the
crying
children
into
his
room
and
let
them
lie
on
his
floor
and
this
gave
him
great
satisfaction
he
got
up
as
before
at
eight
oclock
and
after
his
morning
tea
sat
down
to
read
his
old
books
and
magazines
he
had
no
money
for
new
ones
either
because
the
books
were
old
or
perhaps
because
of
the
change
in
his
surroundings
reading
exhausted
him
and
did
not
grip
his
attention
as
before
that
he
might
not
spend
his
time
in
idleness
he
made
a
detailed
catalogue
of
his
books
and
gummed
little
labels
on
their
backs
and
this
mechanical
tedious
work
seemed
to
him
more
interesting
than
reading
the
monotonous
tedious
work
lulled
his
thoughts
to
sleep
in
some
unaccountable
way
and
the
time
passed
quickly
while
he
thought
of
nothing
even
sitting
in
the
kitchen
peeling
potatoes
with
daryushka
or
picking
over
the
buckwheat
grain
seemed
to
him
interesting
on
saturdays
and
sundays
he
went
to
church
standing
near
the
wall
and
half
closing
his
eyes
he
listened
to
the
singing
and
thought
of
his
father
of
his
mother
of
the
university
of
the
religions
of
the
world
he
felt
calm
and
melancholy
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
church
afterwards
he
regretted
that
the
service
was
so
soon
over
he
went
twice
to
the
hospital
to
talk
to
ivan
dmitritch
but
on
both
occasions
ivan
dmitritch
was
unusually
excited
and
ill
humoured
he
bade
the
doctor
leave
him
in
peace
as
he
had
long
been
sick
of
empty
chatter
and
declared
to
make
up
for
all
his
sufferings
he
asked
from
the
damned
scoundrels
only
one
favoursolitary
confinement
surely
they
would
not
refuse
him
even
that
on
both
occasions
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
taking
leave
of
him
and
wishing
him
good
night
he
answered
rudely
and
said
go
to
hell
and
andrey
yefimitch
did
not
know
now
whether
to
go
to
him
for
the
third
time
or
not
he
longed
to
go
in
old
days
andrey
yefimitch
used
to
walk
about
his
rooms
and
think
in
the
interval
after
dinner
but
now
from
dinner
time
till
evening
tea
he
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
back
and
gave
himself
up
to
trivial
thoughts
which
he
could
not
struggle
against
he
was
mortified
that
after
more
than
twenty
years
of
service
he
had
been
given
neither
a
pension
nor
any
assistance
it
is
true
that
he
had
not
done
his
work
honestly
but
then
all
who
are
in
the
service
get
a
pension
without
distinction
whether
they
are
honest
or
not
contemporary
justice
lies
precisely
in
the
bestowal
of
grades
orders
and
pensions
not
for
moral
qualities
or
capacities
but
for
service
whatever
it
may
have
been
like
why
was
he
alone
to
be
an
exception
he
had
no
money
at
all
he
was
ashamed
to
pass
by
the
shop
and
look
at
the
woman
who
owned
it
he
owed
thirty
two
roubles
for
beer
already
there
was
money
owing
to
the
landlady
also
daryushka
sold
old
clothes
and
books
on
the
sly
and
told
lies
to
the
landlady
saying
that
the
doctor
was
just
going
to
receive
a
large
sum
of
money
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
having
wasted
on
travelling
the
thousand
roubles
he
had
saved
up
how
useful
that
thousand
roubles
would
have
been
now
he
was
vexed
that
people
would
not
leave
him
in
peace
hobotov
thought
it
his
duty
to
look
in
on
his
sick
colleague
from
time
to
time
everything
about
him
was
revolting
to
andrey
yefimitchhis
well
fed
face
and
vulgar
condescending
tone
and
his
use
of
the
word
colleague
and
his
high
top
boots
the
most
revolting
thing
was
that
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
treat
andrey
yefimitch
and
thought
that
he
really
was
treating
him
on
every
visit
he
brought
a
bottle
of
bromide
and
rhubarb
pills
mihail
averyanitch
too
thought
it
his
duty
to
visit
his
friend
and
entertain
him
every
time
he
went
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
with
an
affectation
of
ease
laughed
constrainedly
and
began
assuring
him
that
he
was
looking
very
well
to
day
and
that
thank
god
he
was
on
the
highroad
to
recovery
and
from
this
it
might
be
concluded
that
he
looked
on
his
friends
condition
as
hopeless
he
had
not
yet
repaid
his
warsaw
debt
and
was
overwhelmed
by
shame
he
was
constrained
and
so
tried
to
laugh
louder
and
talk
more
amusingly
his
anecdotes
and
descriptions
seemed
endless
now
and
were
an
agony
both
to
andrey
yefimitch
and
himself
in
his
presence
andrey
yefimitch
usually
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
listened
with
his
teeth
clenched
his
soul
was
oppressed
with
rankling
disgust
and
after
every
visit
from
his
friend
he
felt
as
though
this
disgust
had
risen
higher
and
was
mounting
into
his
throat
to
stifle
petty
thoughts
he
made
haste
to
reflect
that
he
himself
and
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
all
sooner
or
later
perish
without
leaving
any
trace
on
the
world
if
one
imagined
some
spirit
flying
by
the
earthly
globe
in
space
in
a
million
years
he
would
see
nothing
but
clay
and
bare
rocks
everythingculture
and
the
moral
lawwould
pass
away
and
not
even
a
burdock
would
grow
out
of
them
of
what
consequence
was
shame
in
the
presence
of
a
shopkeeper
of
what
consequence
was
the
insignificant
hobotov
or
the
wearisome
friendship
of
mihail
averyanitch
it
was
all
trivial
and
nonsensical
but
such
reflections
did
not
help
him
now
scarcely
had
he
imagined
the
earthly
globe
in
a
million
years
when
hobotov
in
his
high
top
boots
or
mihail
averyanitch
with
his
forced
laugh
would
appear
from
behind
a
bare
rock
and
he
even
heard
the
shamefaced
whisper
the
warsaw
debt
i
will
repay
it
in
a
day
or
two
my
dear
fellow
without
fail
xvi
one
day
mihail
averyanitch
came
after
dinner
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
lying
on
the
sofa
it
so
happened
that
hobotov
arrived
at
the
same
time
with
his
bromide
andrey
yefimitch
got
up
heavily
and
sat
down
leaning
both
arms
on
the
sofa
you
have
a
much
better
colour
to
day
than
you
had
yesterday
my
dear
man
began
mihail
averyanitch
yes
you
look
jolly
upon
my
soul
you
do
its
high
time
you
were
well
dear
colleague
said
hobotov
yawning
ill
be
bound
you
are
sick
of
this
bobbery
and
we
shall
recover
said
mihail
averyanitch
cheerfully
we
shall
live
another
hundred
years
to
be
sure
not
a
hundred
years
but
another
twenty
hobotov
said
reassuringly
its
all
right
all
right
colleague
dont
lose
heart
dont
go
piling
it
on
well
show
what
we
can
do
laughed
mihail
averyanitch
and
he
slapped
his
friend
on
the
knee
well
show
them
yet
next
summer
please
god
we
shall
be
off
to
the
caucasus
and
we
will
ride
all
over
it
on
horsebacktrot
trot
trot
and
when
we
are
back
from
the
caucasus
i
shouldnt
wonder
if
we
will
all
dance
at
the
wedding
mihail
averyanitch
gave
a
sly
wink
well
marry
you
my
dear
boy
well
marry
you
andrey
yefimitch
felt
suddenly
that
the
rising
disgust
had
mounted
to
his
throat
his
heart
began
beating
violently
thats
vulgar
he
said
getting
up
quickly
and
walking
away
to
the
window
dont
you
understand
that
you
are
talking
vulgar
nonsense
he
meant
to
go
on
softly
and
politely
but
against
his
will
he
suddenly
clenched
his
fists
and
raised
them
above
his
head
leave
me
alone
he
shouted
in
a
voice
unlike
his
own
blushing
crimson
and
shaking
all
over
go
away
both
of
you
mihail
averyanitch
and
hobotov
got
up
and
stared
at
him
first
with
amazement
and
then
with
alarm
go
away
both
andrey
yefimitch
went
on
shouting
stupid
people
foolish
people
i
dont
want
either
your
friendship
or
your
medicines
stupid
man
vulgar
nasty
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
looking
at
each
other
in
bewilderment
staggered
to
the
door
and
went
out
andrey
yefimitch
snatched
up
the
bottle
of
bromide
and
flung
it
after
them
the
bottle
broke
with
a
crash
on
the
door
frame
go
to
the
devil
he
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice
running
out
into
the
passage
to
the
devil
when
his
guests
were
gone
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
on
the
sofa
trembling
as
though
in
a
fever
and
went
on
for
a
long
while
repeating
stupid
people
foolish
people
when
he
was
calmer
what
occurred
to
him
first
of
all
was
the
thought
that
poor
mihail
averyanitch
must
be
feeling
fearfully
ashamed
and
depressed
now
and
that
it
was
all
dreadful
nothing
like
this
had
ever
happened
to
him
before
where
was
his
intelligence
and
his
tact
where
was
his
comprehension
of
things
and
his
philosophical
indifference
the
doctor
could
not
sleep
all
night
for
shame
and
vexation
with
himself
and
at
ten
oclock
next
morning
he
went
to
the
post
office
and
apologized
to
the
postmaster
we
wont
think
again
of
what
has
happened
mihail
averyanitch
greatly
touched
said
with
a
sigh
warmly
pressing
his
hand
let
bygones
be
bygones
lyubavkin
he
suddenly
shouted
so
loud
that
all
the
postmen
and
other
persons
present
started
hand
a
chair
and
you
wait
he
shouted
to
a
peasant
woman
who
was
stretching
out
a
registered
letter
to
him
through
the
grating
dont
you
see
that
i
am
busy
we
will
not
remember
the
past
he
went
on
affectionately
addressing
andrey
yefimitch
sit
down
i
beg
you
my
dear
fellow
for
a
minute
he
stroked
his
knees
in
silence
and
then
said
i
have
never
had
a
thought
of
taking
offence
illness
is
no
joke
i
understand
your
attack
frightened
the
doctor
and
me
yesterday
and
we
had
a
long
talk
about
you
afterwards

dear
friend

wont
you
treat
your
illness
seriously

cant
go
on

by
the
postmasters

sympathy
and

tears
which
suddenly
glittered
on
his
cheeks
my
honoured
friend

whispered
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
dont
believe
them
its
all
a
sham
my
illness
is
only
that
in
twenty
years
i
have
only
found
one
intelligent
man
in
the
whole
town
and
he
is
mad
i
am
not
ill
at
all
its
simply
that
i
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
which
there
is
no
getting
out
of
i
dont
care
i
am
ready
for
anything
go
into
the
hospital
my
dear
fellow
i
dont
care
if

were
into
the
pit

me
your
word
my
dear
man
that
you

obey
yevgeny
fyodoritch
in
everything
certainly
i
will
give
you
my
word
but
i
repeat
my
honoured
friend
i
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
now
everything
even
the
genuine
sympathy
of
my
friends
leads
to
the
same
thingto
my
ruin
i
am
going
to
my
ruin
and
i
have
the
manliness
to
recognize
it
my
dear
fellow
you
will
recover
whats
the
use
of
saying
that
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
irritation
there
are
few
men
who
at
the
end
of
their
lives
do
not
experience
what
i
am
experiencing
now
when
you
are
told
that
you
have
something
such
as
diseased
kidneys
or
enlarged
heart
and
you
begin
being
treated
for
it
or
are
told
you
are
mad
or
a
criminalthat
is
in
fact
when
people
suddenly
turn
their
attention
to
youyou
may
be
sure
you
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
from
which
you
will
not
escape
you
will
try
to
escape
and
make
things
worse
you
had
better
give
in
for
no
human
efforts
can
save
you
so
it
seems
to
me
meanwhile
the
public
was
crowding
at
the
grating
that
he
might
not
be
in
their
way
andrey
yefimitch
got
up
and
began
to
take
leave
mihail
averyanitch
made
him
promise
on
his
honour
once
more
and
escorted
him
to
the
outer
door
towards
evening
on
the
same
day
hobotov
in
his
sheepskin
and
his
high
top
boots
suddenly
made
his
appearance
and
said
to
andrey
yefimitch
in
a
tone
as
though
nothing
had
happened
the
day
before
i
have
come
on
business
colleague
i
have
come
to
ask
you
whether
you
would
not
join
me
in
a
consultation
eh
thinking
that
hobotov
wanted
to
distract
his
mind
with
an
outing
or
perhaps
really
to
enable
him
to
earn
something
andrey
yefimitch
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
out
with
him
into
the
street
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
smooth
over
his
fault
of
the
previous
day
and
to
be
reconciled
and
in
his
heart
thanked
hobotov
who
did
not
even
allude
to
yesterdays
scene
and
was
evidently
sparing
him
one
would
never
have
expected
such
delicacy
from
this
uncultured
man
where
is
your
invalid
asked
andrey
yefimitch
in
the
hospital
i
have
long
wanted
to
show
him
to
you
a
very
interesting
case
they
went
into
the
hospital
yard
and
going
round
the
main
building
turned
towards
the
lodge
where
the
mental
cases
were
kept
and
all
this
for
some
reason
in
silence
when
they
went
into
the
lodge
nikita
as
usual
jumped
up
and
stood
at
attention
one
of
the
patients
here
has
a
lung
complication
hobotov
said
in
an
undertone
going
into
the
yard
with
andrey
yefimitch
you
wait
here
ill
be
back
directly
i
am
going
for
a
stethoscope
and
he
went
away
xvii
it
was
getting
dusk
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
on
his
bed
with
his
face
thrust
unto
his
pillow
the
paralytic
was
sitting
motionless
crying
quietly
and
moving
his
lips
the
fat
peasant
and
the
former
sorter
were
asleep
it
was
quiet
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
on
ivan
dmitritchs
bed
and
waited
but
half
an
hour
passed
and
instead
of
hobotov
nikita
came
into
the
ward
with
a
dressing
gown
some
underlinen
and
a
pair
of
slippers
in
a
heap
on
his
arm
please
change
your
things
your
honour
he
said
softly
here
is
your
bed
come
this
way
he
added
pointing
to
an
empty
bedstead
which
had
obviously
recently
been
brought
into
the
ward
its
all
right
please
god
you
will
recover
andrey
yefimitch
understood
it
all
without
saying
a
word
he
crossed
to
the
bed
to
which
nikita
pointed
and
sat
down
seeing
that
nikita
was
standing
waiting
he
undressed
entirely
and
he
felt
ashamed
then
he
put
on
the
hospital
clothes
the
drawers
were
very
short
the
shirt
was
long
and
the
dressing
gown
smelt
of
smoked
fish
please
god
you
will
recover
repeated
nikita
and
he
gathered
up
andrey
yefimitchs
clothes
into
his
arms
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
no
matter
thought
andrey
yefimitch
wrapping
himself
in
his
dressing
gown
in
a
shamefaced
way
and
feeling
that
he
looked
like
a
convict
in
his
new
costume
its
no
matter
it
does
not
matter
whether
its
a
dress
coat
or
a
uniform
or
this
dressing
gown
but
how
about
his
watch
and
the
notebook
that
was
in
the
side
pocket
and
his
cigarettes
where
had
nikita
taken
his
clothes
now
perhaps
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
would
not
put
on
trousers
a
waistcoat
and
high
boots
it
was
all
somehow
strange
and
even
incomprehensible
at
first
andrey
yefimitch
was
even
now
convinced
that
there
was
no
difference
between
his
landladys
house
and
ward
no
that
everything
in
this
world
was
nonsense
and
vanity
of
vanities
and
yet
his
hands
were
trembling
his
feet
were
cold
and
he
was
filled
with
dread
at
the
thought
that
soon
ivan
dmitritch
would
get
up
and
see
that
he
was
in
a
dressing
gown
he
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
and
sat
down
again
here
he
had
been
sitting
already
half
an
hour
an
hour
and
he
was
miserably
sick
of
it
was
it
really
possible
to
live
here
a
day
a
week
and
even
years
like
these
people
why
he
had
been
sitting
here
had
walked
about
and
sat
down
again
he
could
get
up
and
look
out
of
window
and
walk
from
corner
to
corner
again
and
then
what
sit
so
all
the
time
like
a
post
and
think
no
that
was
scarcely
possible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
but
at
once
got
up
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
his
brow
with
his
sleeve
and
felt
that
his
whole
face
smelt
of
smoked
fish
he
walked
about
again
its
some
misunderstanding
he
said
turning
out
the
palms
of
his
hands
in
perplexity
it
must
be
cleared
up
there
is
a
misunderstanding
meanwhile
ivan
dmitritch
woke
up
he
sat
up
and
propped
his
cheeks
on
his
fists
he
spat
then
he
glanced
lazily
at
the
doctor
and
apparently
for
the
first
minute
did
not
understand
but
soon
his
sleepy
face
grew
malicious
and
mocking
aha
so
they
have
put
you
in
here
too
old
fellow
he
said
in
a
voice
husky
from
sleepiness
screwing
up
one
eye
very
glad
to
see
you
you
sucked
the
blood
of
others
and
now
they
will
suck
yours
excellent
its
a
misunderstanding
andrey
yefimitch
brought
out
frightened
by
ivan
dmitritchs
words
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
repeated
its
some
misunderstanding
ivan
dmitritch
spat
again
and
lay
down
cursed
life
he
grumbled
and
whats
bitter
and
insulting
this
life
will
not
end
in
compensation
for
our
sufferings
it
will
not
end
with
apotheosis
as
it
would
in
an
opera
but
with
death
peasants
will
come
and
drag
ones
dead
body
by
the
arms
and
the
legs
to
the
cellar
ugh
well
it
does
not
matter
we
shall
have
our
good
time
in
the
other
world
i
shall
come
here
as
a
ghost
from
the
other
world
and
frighten
these
reptiles
ill
turn
their
hair
grey
moiseika
returned
and
seeing
the
doctor
held
out
his
hand
give
me
one
little
kopeck
he
said
xviii
andrey
yefimitch
walked
away
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
open
country
it
was
getting
dark
and
on
the
horizon
to
the
right
a
cold
crimson
moon
was
mounting
upwards
not
far
from
the
hospital
fence
not
much
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
stood
a
tall
white
house
shut
in
by
a
stone
wall
this
was
the
prison
so
this
is
real
life
thought
andrey
yefimitch
and
he
felt
frightened
the
moon
and
the
prison
and
the
nails
on
the
fence
and
the
far
away
flames
at
the
bone
charring
factory
were
all
terrible
behind
him
there
was
the
sound
of
a
sigh
andrey
yefimitch
looked
round
and
saw
a
man
with
glittering
stars
and
orders
on
his
breast
who
was
smiling
and
slyly
winking
and
this
too
seemed
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
assured
himself
that
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
moon
or
the
prison
that
even
sane
persons
wear
orders
and
that
everything
in
time
will
decay
and
turn
to
earth
but
he
was
suddenly
overcome
with
desire
he
clutched
at
the
grating
with
both
hands
and
shook
it
with
all
his
might
the
strong
grating
did
not
yield
then
that
it
might
not
be
so
dreadful
he
went
to
ivan
dmitritchs
bed
and
sat
down
i
have
lost
heart
my
dear
fellow
he
muttered
trembling
and
wiping
away
the
cold
sweat
i
have
lost
heart
you
should
be
philosophical
said
ivan
dmitritch
ironically
my
god
my
god
yes
yes
you
were
pleased
to
say
once
that
there
was
no
philosophy
in
russia
but
that
all
people
even
the
paltriest
talk
philosophy
but
you
know
the
philosophizing
of
the
paltriest
does
not
harm
anyone
said
andrey
yefimitch
in
a
tone
as
if
he
wanted
to
cry
and
complain
why
then
that
malignant
laugh
my
friend
and
how
can
these
paltry
creatures
help
philosophizing
if
they
are
not
satisfied
for
an
intelligent
educated
man
made
in
gods
image
proud
and
loving
freedom
to
have
no
alternative
but
to
be
a
doctor
in
a
filthy
stupid
wretched
little
town
and
to
spend
his
whole
life
among
bottles
leeches
mustard
plasters
quackery
narrowness
vulgarity
oh
my
god
you
are
talking
nonsense
if
you
dont
like
being
a
doctor
you
should
have
gone
in
for
being
a
statesman
i
could
not
i
could
not
do
anything
we
are
weak
my
dear
friend
i
used
to
be
indifferent
i
reasoned
boldly
and
soundly
but
at
the
first
coarse
touch
of
life
upon
me
i
have
lost
heart
prostration
we
are
weak
we
are
poor
creatures
and
you
too
my
dear
friend
you
are
intelligent
generous
you
drew
in
good
impulses
with
your
mothers
milk
but
you
had
hardly
entered
upon
life
when
you
were
exhausted
and
fell
ill
weak
weak
andrey
yefimitch
was
all
the
while
at
the
approach
of
evening
tormented
by
another
persistent
sensation
besides
terror
and
the
feeling
of
resentment
at
last
he
realized
that
he
was
longing
for
a
smoke
and
for
beer
i
am
going
out
my
friend
he
said
i
will
tell
them
to
bring
a
light
i
cant
put
up
with
this
i
am
not
equal
to
it
andrey
yefimitch
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
but
at
once
nikita
jumped
up
and
barred
his
way
where
are
you
going
you
cant
you
cant
he
said
its
bedtime
but
im
only
going
out
for
a
minute
to
walk
about
the
yard
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
cant
you
cant
its
forbidden
you
know
that
yourself
but
what
difference
will
it
make
to
anyone
if
i
do
go
out
asked
andrey
yefimitch
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
dont
understand
nikita
i
must
go
out
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
i
must
dont
be
disorderly
its
not
right
nikita
said
peremptorily
this
is
beyond
everything
ivan
dmitritch
cried
suddenly
and
he
jumped
up
what
right
has
he
not
to
let
you
out
how
dare
they
keep
us
here
i
believe
it
is
clearly
laid
down
in
the
law
that
no
one
can
be
deprived
of
freedom
without
trial
its
an
outrage
its
tyranny
of
course
its
tyranny
said
andrey
yefimitch
encouraged
by
ivan
dmitritchs
outburst
i
must
go
out
i
want
to
he
has
no
right
open
i
tell
you
do
you
hear
you
dull
witted
brute
cried
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
banged
on
the
door
with
his
fist
open
the
door
or
i
will
break
it
open
torturer
open
the
door
cried
andrey
yefimitch
trembling
all
over
i
insist
talk
away
nikita
answered
through
the
door
talk
away
anyhow
go
and
call
yevgeny
fyodoritch
say
that
i
beg
him
to
come
for
a
minute
his
honour
will
come
of
himself
to
morrow
they
will
never
let
us
out
ivan
dmitritch
was
going
on
meanwhile
they
will
leave
us
to
rot
here
oh
lord
can
there
really
be
no
hell
in
the
next
world
and
will
these
wretches
be
forgiven
where
is
justice
open
the
door
you
wretch
i
am
choking
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
flung
himself
upon
the
door
ill
dash
out
my
brains
murderers
nikita
opened
the
door
quickly
and
roughly
with
both
his
hands
and
his
knee
shoved
andrey
yefimitch
back
then
swung
his
arm
and
punched
him
in
the
face
with
his
fist
it
seemed
to
andrey
yefimitch
as
though
a
huge
salt
wave
enveloped
him
from
his
head
downwards
and
dragged
him
to
the
bed
there
really
was
a
salt
taste
in
his
mouth
most
likely
the
blood
was
running
from
his
teeth
he
waved
his
arms
as
though
he
were
trying
to
swim
out
and
clutched
at
a
bedstead
and
at
the
same
moment
felt
nikita
hit
him
twice
on
the
back
ivan
dmitritch
gave
a
loud
scream
he
must
have
been
beaten
too
then
all
was
still
the
faint
moonlight
came
through
the
grating
and
a
shadow
like
a
net
lay
on
the
floor
it
was
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
and
held
his
breath
he
was
expecting
with
horror
to
be
struck
again
he
felt
as
though
someone
had
taken
a
sickle
thrust
it
into
him
and
turned
it
round
several
times
in
his
breast
and
bowels
he
bit
the
pillow
from
pain
and
clenched
his
teeth
and
all
at
once
through
the
chaos
in
his
brain
there
flashed
the
terrible
unbearable
thought
that
these
people
who
seemed
now
like
black
shadows
in
the
moonlight
had
to
endure
such
pain
day
by
day
for
years
how
could
it
have
happened
that
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
had
not
known
it
and
had
refused
to
know
it
he
knew
nothing
of
pain
had
no
conception
of
it
so
he
was
not
to
blame
but
his
conscience
as
inexorable
and
as
rough
as
nikita
made
him
turn
cold
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
his
heels
he
leaped
up
tried
to
cry
out
with
all
his
might
and
to
run
in
haste
to
kill
nikita
and
then
hobotov
the
superintendent
and
the
assistant
and
then
himself
but
no
sound
came
from
his
chest
and
his
legs
would
not
obey
him
gasping
for
breath
he
tore
at
the
dressing
gown
and
the
shirt
on
his
breast
rent
them
and
fell
senseless
on
the
bed
xix
next
morning
his
head
ached
there
was
a
droning
in
his
ears
and
a
feeling
of
utter
weakness
all
over
he
was
not
ashamed
at
recalling
his
weakness
the
day
before
he
had
been
cowardly
had
even
been
afraid
of
the
moon
had
openly
expressed
thoughts
and
feelings
such
as
he
had
not
expected
in
himself
before
for
instance
the
thought
that
the
paltry
people
who
philosophized
were
really
dissatisfied
but
now
nothing
mattered
to
him
he
ate
nothing
he
drank
nothing
he
lay
motionless
and
silent
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
he
thought
when
they
asked
him
questions
i
am
not
going
to
answer
its
all
the
same
to
me
after
dinner
mihail
averyanitch
brought
him
a
quarter
pound
of
tea
and
a
pound
of
fruit
pastilles
daryushka
came
too
and
stood
for
a
whole
hour
by
the
bed
with
an
expression
of
dull
grief
on
her
face
