not
he
himself
faces
motionless
eyes
bent
upon
him
he
read
not
sympathy
not
commiseration
which
he
could
not
endure
but
something
else
something
soft
tender
but
same
time
intensely
sinister
like
terrible
truth
something
which
one
instant
turned
him
cold
over
filled
soul
with
unutterable
despair
with
pale
distorted
face
he
suddenly
jumped
clutched
head
quarter
minute
he
stood
like
that
stared
with
horror
fixed
point
before
him
though
he
saw
swiftly
coming
death
