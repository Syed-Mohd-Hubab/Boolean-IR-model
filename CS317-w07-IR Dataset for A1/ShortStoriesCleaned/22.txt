the
schoolmaster
fyodor
lukitch
sysoev
the
master
of
the
factory
school
maintained
at
the
expense
of
the
firm
of
kulikin
was
getting
ready
for
the
annual
dinner
every
year
after
the
school
examination
the
board
of
managers
gave
a
dinner
at
which
the
inspector
of
elementary
schools
all
who
had
conducted
the
examinations
and
all
the
managers
and
foremen
of
the
factory
were
present
in
spite
of
their
official
character
these
dinners
were
always
good
and
lively
and
the
guests
sat
a
long
time
over
them
forgetting
distinctions
of
rank
and
recalling
only
their
meritorious
labours
they
ate
till
they
were
full
drank
amicably
chattered
till
they
were
all
hoarse
and
parted
late
in
the
evening
deafening
the
whole
factory
settlement
with
their
singing
and
the
sound
of
their
kisses
of
such
dinners
sysoev
had
taken
part
in
thirteen
as
he
had
been
that
number
of
years
master
of
the
factory
school
now
getting
ready
for
the
fourteenth
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
look
as
festive
and
correct
as
possible
he
had
spent
a
whole
hour
brushing
his
new
black
suit
and
spent
almost
as
long
in
front
of
a
looking
glass
while
he
put
on
a
fashionable
shirt
the
studs
would
not
go
into
the
button
holes
and
this
circumstance
called
forth
a
perfect
storm
of
complaints
threats
and
reproaches
addressed
to
his
wife
his
poor
wife
bustling
round
him
wore
herself
out
with
her
efforts
and
indeed
he
too
was
exhausted
in
the
end
when
his
polished
boots
were
brought
him
from
the
kitchen
he
had
not
strength
to
pull
them
on
he
had
to
lie
down
and
have
a
drink
of
water
how
weak
you
have
grown
sighed
his
wife
you
ought
not
to
go
to
this
dinner
at
all
no
advice
please
the
schoolmaster
cut
her
short
angrily
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
for
he
had
been
much
displeased
with
the
recent
examinations
the
examinations
had
gone
off
splendidly
all
the
boys
of
the
senior
division
had
gained
certificates
and
prizes
both
the
managers
of
the
factory
and
the
government
officials
were
pleased
with
the
results
but
that
was
not
enough
for
the
schoolmaster
he
was
vexed
that
babkin
a
boy
who
never
made
a
mistake
in
writing
had
made
three
mistakes
in
the
dictation
sergeyev
another
boy
had
been
so
excited
that
he
could
not
remember
seventeen
times
thirteen
the
inspector
a
young
and
inexperienced
man
had
chosen
a
difficult
article
for
dictation
and
lyapunov
the
master
of
a
neighbouring
school
whom
the
inspector
had
asked
to
dictate
had
not
behaved
like
a
good
comrade
but
in
dictating
had
as
it
were
swallowed
the
words
and
had
not
pronounced
them
as
written
after
pulling
on
his
boots
with
the
assistance
of
his
wife
and
looking
at
himself
once
more
in
the
looking
glass
the
schoolmaster
took
his
gnarled
stick
and
set
off
for
the
dinner
just
before
the
factory
managers
house
where
the
festivity
was
to
take
place
he
had
a
little
mishap
he
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
he
was
so
shaken
by
it
that
the
cap
flew
off
his
head
and
the
stick
dropped
out
of
his
hand
and
when
the
school
inspector
and
the
teachers
hearing
his
cough
ran
out
of
the
house
he
was
sitting
on
the
bottom
step
bathed
in
perspiration
fyodor
lukitch
is
that
you
said
the
inspector
surprised
you
have
come
why
not
you
ought
to
be
at
home
my
dear
fellow
you
are
not
at
all
well
to
day
i
am
just
the
same
to
day
as
i
was
yesterday
and
if
my
presence
is
not
agreeable
to
you
i
can
go
back
oh
fyodor
lukitch
you
must
not
talk
like
that
please
come
in
why
the
function
is
really
in
your
honour
not
ours
and
we
are
delighted
to
see
you
of
course
we
are
within
everything
was
ready
for
the
banquet
in
the
big
dining
room
adorned
with
german
oleographs
and
smelling
of
geraniums
and
varnish
there
were
two
tables
a
larger
one
for
the
dinner
and
a
smaller
one
for
the
hors
doeuvres
the
hot
light
of
midday
faintly
percolated
through
the
lowered
blinds
the
twilight
of
the
room
the
swiss
views
on
the
blinds
the
geraniums
the
thin
slices
of
sausage
on
the
plates
all
had
a
nave
girlishly
sentimental
air
and
it
was
all
in
keeping
with
the
master
of
the
house
a
good
natured
little
german
with
a
round
little
stomach
and
affectionate
oily
little
eyes
adolf
andreyitch
bruni
that
was
his
name
was
bustling
round
the
table
of
hors
doeuvres
as
zealously
as
though
it
were
a
house
on
fire
filling
up
the
wine
glasses
loading
the
plates
and
trying
in
every
way
to
please
to
amuse
and
to
show
his
friendly
feelings
he
clapped
people
on
the
shoulder
looked
into
their
eyes
chuckled
rubbed
his
hands
in
fact
was
as
ingratiating
as
a
friendly
dog
whom
do
i
behold
fyodor
lukitch
he
said
in
a
jerky
voice
on
seeing
sysoev
how
delightful
you
have
come
in
spite
of
your
illness
gentlemen
let
me
congratulate
you
fyodor
lukitch
has
come
the
school
teachers
were
already
crowding
round
the
table
and
eating
the
hors
doeuvres
sysoev
frowned
he
was
displeased
that
his
colleagues
had
begun
to
eat
and
drink
without
waiting
for
him
he
noticed
among
them
lyapunov
the
man
who
had
dictated
at
the
examination
and
going
up
to
him
began
it
was
not
acting
like
a
comrade
no
indeed
gentlemanly
people
dont
dictate
like
that
good
lord
you
are
still
harping
on
it
said
lyapunov
and
he
frowned
arent
you
sick
of
it
yes
still
harping
on
it
my
babkin
has
never
made
mistakes
i
know
why
you
dictated
like
that
you
simply
wanted
my
pupils
to
be
floored
so
that
your
school
might
seem
better
than
mine
i
know
all
about
it
why
are
you
trying
to
get
up
a
quarrel
lyapunov
snarled
why
the
devil
do
you
pester
me
come
gentlemen
interposed
the
inspector
making
a
woebegone
face
is
it
worth
while
to
get
so
heated
over
a
trifle
three
mistakes
not
one
mistake
does
it
matter
yes
it
does
matter
babkin
has
never
made
mistakes
he
wont
leave
off
lyapunov
went
on
snorting
angrily
he
takes
advantage
of
his
position
as
an
invalid
and
worries
us
all
to
death
well
sir
i
am
not
going
to
consider
your
being
ill
let
my
illness
alone
cried
sysoev
angrily
what
is
it
to
do
with
you
they
all
keep
repeating
it
at
me
illness
illness
illness
as
though
i
need
your
sympathy
besides
where
have
you
picked
up
the
notion
that
i
am
ill
i
was
ill
before
the
examinations
thats
true
but
now
i
have
completely
recovered
there
is
nothing
left
of
it
but
weakness
you
have
regained
your
health
well
thank
god
said
the
scripture
teacher
father
nikolay
a
young
priest
in
a
foppish
cinnamon
coloured
cassock
and
trousers
outside
his
boots
you
ought
to
rejoice
but
you
are
irritable
and
so
on
you
are
a
nice
one
too
sysoev
interrupted
him
questions
ought
to
be
straightforward
clear
but
you
kept
asking
riddles
thats
not
the
thing
to
do
by
combined
efforts
they
succeeded
in
soothing
him
and
making
him
sit
down
to
the
table
he
was
a
long
time
making
up
his
mind
what
to
drink
and
pulling
a
wry
face
drank
a
wine
glass
of
some
green
liqueur
then
he
drew
a
bit
of
pie
towards
him
and
sulkily
picked
out
of
the
inside
an
egg
with
onion
on
it
at
the
first
mouthful
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
no
salt
in
it
he
sprinkled
salt
on
it
and
at
once
pushed
it
away
as
the
pie
was
too
salt
at
dinner
sysoev
was
seated
between
the
inspector
and
bruni
after
the
first
course
the
toasts
began
according
to
the
old
established
custom
i
consider
it
my
agreeable
duty
the
inspector
began
to
propose
a
vote
of
thanks
to
the
absent
school
wardens
daniel
petrovitch
and
and
and
and
ivan
petrovitch
bruni
prompted
him
and
ivan
petrovitch
kulikin
who
grudge
no
expense
for
the
school
and
i
propose
to
drink
their
health
for
my
part
said
bruni
jumping
up
as
though
he
had
been
stung
i
propose
a
toast
to
the
health
of
the
honoured
inspector
of
elementary
schools
pavel
gennadievitch
nadarov
chairs
were
pushed
back
faces
beamed
with
smiles
and
the
usual
cblinking
of
glasses
began
the
third
toast
always
fell
to
sysoev
and
on
this
occasion
too
he
got
up
and
began
to
speak
looking
grave
and
clearing
his
throat
he
first
of
all
announced
that
he
had
not
the
gift
of
eloquence
and
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
make
a
speech
further
he
said
that
during
the
fourteen
years
that
he
had
been
schoolmaster
there
had
been
many
intrigues
many
underhand
attacks
and
even
secret
reports
on
him
to
the
authorities
and
that
he
knew
his
enemies
and
those
who
had
informed
against
him
and
he
would
not
mention
their
names
for
fear
of
spoiling
somebodys
appetite
that
in
spite
of
these
intrigues
the
kulikin
school
held
the
foremost
place
in
the
whole
province
not
only
from
a
moral
but
also
from
a
material
point
of
view
everywhere
else
he
said
schoolmasters
get
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
roubles
while
i
get
five
hundred
and
moreover
my
house
has
been
redecorated
and
even
furnished
at
the
expense
of
the
firm
and
this
year
all
the
walls
have
been
repapered
further
the
schoolmaster
enlarged
on
the
liberality
with
which
the
pupils
were
provided
with
writing
materials
in
the
factory
schools
as
compared
with
the
zemstvo
and
government
schools
and
for
all
this
the
school
was
indebted
in
his
opinion
not
to
the
heads
of
the
firm
who
lived
abroad
and
scarcely
knew
of
its
existence
but
to
a
man
who
in
spite
of
his
german
origin
and
lutheran
faith
was
a
russian
at
heart
sysoev
spoke
at
length
with
pauses
to
get
his
breath
and
with
pretensions
to
rhetoric
and
his
speech
was
boring
and
unpleasant
he
several
times
referred
to
certain
enemies
of
his
tried
to
drop
hints
repeated
himself
coughed
and
flourished
his
fingers
unbecomingly
at
last
he
was
exhausted
and
in
a
perspiration
and
he
began
talking
jerkily
in
a
low
voice
as
though
to
himself
and
finished
his
speech
not
quite
coherently
and
so
i
propose
the
health
of
bruni
that
is
adolf
andreyitch
who
is
here
among
us
generally
speaking
you
understand
when
he
finished
everyone
gave
a
faint
sigh
as
though
someone
had
sprinkled
cold
water
and
cleared
the
air
bruni
alone
apparently
had
no
unpleasant
feeling
beaming
and
rolling
his
sentimental
eyes
the
german
shook
sysoevs
hand
with
feeling
and
was
again
as
friendly
as
a
dog
oh
i
thank
you
he
said
with
an
emphasis
on
the
oh
laying
his
left
hand
on
his
heart
i
am
very
happy
that
you
understand
me
i
with
my
whole
heart
wish
you
all
things
good
but
i
ought
only
to
observe
you
exaggerate
my
importance
the
school
owes
its
flourishing
condition
only
to
you
my
honoured
friend
fyodor
lukitch
but
for
you
it
would
be
in
no
way
distinguished
from
other
schools
you
think
the
german
is
paying
a
compliment
the
german
is
saying
something
polite
ha
ha
no
my
dear
fyodor
lukitch
i
am
an
honest
man
and
never
make
complimentary
speeches
if
we
pay
you
five
hundred
roubles
a
year
it
is
because
you
are
valued
by
us
isnt
that
so
gentlemen
what
i
say
is
true
isnt
it
we
should
not
pay
anyone
else
so
much
why
a
good
school
is
an
honour
to
the
factory
i
must
sincerely
own
that
your
school
is
really
exceptional
said
the
inspector
dont
think
this
is
flattery
anyway
i
have
never
come
across
another
like
it
in
my
life
as
i
sat
at
the
examination
i
was
full
of
admiration
wonderful
children
they
know
a
great
deal
and
answer
brightly
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
somehow
special
unconstrained
sincere
one
can
see
that
they
love
you
fyodor
lukitch
you
are
a
schoolmaster
to
the
marrow
of
your
bones
you
must
have
been
born
a
teacher
you
have
all
the
gifts
innate
vocation
long
experience
and
love
for
your
work
its
simply
amazing
considering
the
weak
state
of
your
health
what
energy
what
understanding
what
perseverance
do
you
understand
what
confidence
you
have
some
one
in
the
school
committee
said
truly
that
you
were
a
poet
in
your
work
yes
a
poet
you
are
and
all
present
at
the
dinner
began
as
one
man
talking
of
sysoevs
extraordinary
talent
and
as
though
a
dam
had
been
burst
there
followed
a
flood
of
sincere
enthusiastic
words
such
as
men
do
not
utter
when
they
are
restrained
by
prudent
and
cautious
sobriety
sysoevs
speech
and
his
intolerable
temper
and
the
horrid
spiteful
expression
on
his
face
were
all
forgotten
everyone
talked
freely
even
the
shy
and
silent
new
teachers
poverty
stricken
down
trodden
youths
who
never
spoke
to
the
inspector
without
addressing
him
as
your
honour
it
was
clear
that
in
his
own
circle
sysoev
was
a
person
of
consequence
having
been
accustomed
to
success
and
praise
for
the
fourteen
years
that
he
had
been
schoolmaster
he
listened
with
indifference
to
the
noisy
enthusiasm
of
his
admirers
it
was
bruni
who
drank
in
the
praise
instead
of
the
schoolmaster
the
german
caught
every
word
beamed
clapped
his
hands
and
flushed
modestly
as
though
the
praise
referred
not
to
the
schoolmaster
but
to
him
bravo
bravo
he
shouted
thats
true
you
have
grasped
my
meaning
excellent
he
looked
into
the
schoolmasters
eyes
as
though
he
wanted
to
share
his
bliss
with
him
at
last
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
leapt
up
and
overpowering
all
the
other
voices
with
his
shrill
little
tenor
shouted
gentlemen
allow
me
to
speak
sh
h
to
all
you
say
i
can
make
only
one
reply
the
management
of
the
factory
will
not
be
forgetful
of
what
it
owes
to
fyodor
lukitch
all
were
silent
sysoev
raised
his
eyes
to
the
germans
rosy
face
we
know
how
to
appreciate
it
bruni
went
on
dropping
his
voice
in
response
to
your
words
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
fyodor
lukitchs
family
will
be
provided
for
and
that
a
sum
of
money
was
placed
in
the
bank
a
month
ago
for
that
object
sysoev
looked
enquiringly
at
the
german
at
his
colleagues
as
though
unable
to
understand
why
his
family
should
be
provided
for
and
not
he
himself
and
at
once
on
all
the
faces
in
all
the
motionless
eyes
bent
upon
him
he
read
not
the
sympathy
not
the
commiseration
which
he
could
not
endure
but
something
else
something
soft
tender
but
at
the
same
time
intensely
sinister
like
a
terrible
truth
something
which
in
one
instant
turned
him
cold
all
over
and
filled
his
soul
with
unutterable
despair
with
a
pale
distorted
face
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
clutched
at
his
head
for
a
quarter
of
a
minute
he
stood
like
that
stared
with
horror
at
a
fixed
point
before
him
as
though
he
saw
the
swiftly
coming
death
of
which
bruni
was
speaking
then
sat
down
and
burst
into
tears
come
come
what
is
it
he
heard
agitated
voices
saying
water
drink
a
little
water
a
short
time
passed
and
the
schoolmaster
grew
calmer
but
the
party
did
not
recover
their
previous
liveliness
the
dinner
ended
in
gloomy
silence
and
much
earlier
than
on
previous
occasions
when
he
got
home
sysoev
first
of
all
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
of
course
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
blubber
like
that
he
thought
looking
at
his
sunken
cheeks
and
his
eyes
with
dark
rings
under
them
my
face
is
a
much
better
colour
to
day
than
yesterday
i
am
suffering
from
anemia
and
catarrh
of
the
stomach
and
my
cough
is
only
a
stomach
cough
reassured
he
slowly
began
undressing
and
spent
a
long
time
brushing
his
new
black
suit
then
carefully
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
the
chest
of
drawers
then
he
went
up
to
the
table
where
there
lay
a
pile
of
his
pupils
exercise
books
and
picking
out
babkins
sat
down
and
fell
to
contemplating
the
beautiful
childish
handwriting
and
meantime
while
he
was
examining
the
exercise
books
the
district
doctor
was
sitting
in
the
next
room
and
telling
his
wife
in
a
whisper
that
a
man
ought
not
to
have
been
allowed
to
go
out
to
dinner
who
had
not
in
all
probability
more
than
a
week
to
live
