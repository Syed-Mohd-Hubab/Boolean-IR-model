an
inadvertence
pyotr
petrovitch
strizhin
the
nephew
of
madame
ivanov
the
colonels
widowthe
man
whose
new
goloshes
were
stolen
last
yearcame
home
from
a
christening
party
at
two
oclock
in
the
morning
to
avoid
waking
the
household
he
took
off
his
things
in
the
lobby
made
his
way
on
tiptoe
to
his
room
holding
his
breath
and
began
getting
ready
for
bed
without
lighting
a
candle
strizhin
leads
a
sober
and
regular
life
he
has
a
sanctimonious
expression
of
face
he
reads
nothing
but
religious
and
edifying
books
but
at
the
christening
party
in
his
delight
that
lyubov
spiridonovna
had
passed
through
her
confinement
successfully
he
had
permitted
himself
to
drink
four
glasses
of
vodka
and
a
glass
of
wine
the
taste
of
which
suggested
something
midway
between
vinegar
and
castor
oil
spirituous
liquors
are
like
sea
water
and
glory
the
more
you
imbibe
of
them
the
greater
your
thirst
and
now
as
he
undressed
strizhin
was
aware
of
an
overwhelming
craving
for
drink
i
believe
dashenka
has
some
vodka
in
the
cupboard
in
the
right
hand
corner
he
thought
if
i
drink
one
wine
glassful
she
wont
notice
it
after
some
hesitation
overcoming
his
fears
strizhin
went
to
the
cupboard
cautiously
opening
the
door
he
felt
in
the
right
hand
corner
for
a
bottle
and
poured
out
a
wine
glassful
put
the
bottle
back
in
its
place
then
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
drank
it
off
and
immediately
something
like
a
miracle
took
place
strizhin
was
flung
back
from
the
cupboard
to
the
chest
with
fearful
force
like
a
bomb
there
were
flashes
before
his
eyes
he
felt
as
though
he
could
not
breathe
and
all
over
his
body
he
had
a
sensation
as
though
he
had
fallen
into
a
marsh
full
of
leeches
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
instead
of
vodka
he
had
swallowed
dynamite
which
blew
up
his
body
the
house
and
the
whole
street
his
head
his
arms
his
legsall
seemed
to
be
torn
off
and
to
be
flying
away
somewhere
to
the
devil
into
space
for
some
three
minutes
he
lay
on
the
chest
not
moving
and
scarcely
breathing
then
he
got
up
and
asked
himself
where
am
i
the
first
thing
of
which
he
was
clearly
conscious
on
coming
to
himself
was
the
pronounced
smell
of
paraffin
holy
saints
he
thought
in
horror
its
paraffin
i
have
drunk
instead
of
vodka
the
thought
that
he
had
poisoned
himself
threw
him
into
a
cold
shiver
then
into
a
fever
that
it
was
really
poison
that
he
had
taken
was
proved
not
only
by
the
smell
in
the
room
but
also
by
the
burning
taste
in
his
mouth
the
flashes
before
his
eyes
the
ringing
in
his
head
and
the
colicky
pain
in
his
stomach
feeling
the
approach
of
death
and
not
buoying
himself
up
with
false
hopes
he
wanted
to
say
good
bye
to
those
nearest
to
him
and
made
his
way
to
dashenkas
bedroom
being
a
widower
he
had
his
sister
in
law
called
dashenka
an
old
maid
living
in
the
flat
to
keep
house
for
him
dashenka
he
said
in
a
tearful
voice
as
he
went
into
the
bedroom
dear
dashenka
something
grumbled
in
the
darkness
and
uttered
a
deep
sigh
dashenka
eh
what
a
womans
voice
articulated
rapidly
is
that
you
pyotr
petrovitch
are
you
back
already
well
what
is
it
what
has
the
baby
been
christened
who
was
godmother
the
godmother
was
natalya
andreyevna
velikosvyetsky
and
the
godfather
pavel
ivanitch
bezsonnitsin
i
i
believe
dashenka
i
am
dying
and
the
baby
has
been
christened
olimpiada
in
honour
of
their
kind
patroness
i
i
have
just
drunk
paraffin
dashenka
what
next
you
dont
say
they
gave
you
paraffin
there
i
must
own
i
wanted
to
get
a
drink
of
vodka
without
asking
you
and
and
the
lord
chastised
me
by
accident
in
the
dark
i
took
paraffin
what
am
i
to
do
dashenka
hearing
that
the
cupboard
had
been
opened
without
her
permission
grew
more
wide
awake
she
quickly
lighted
a
candle
jumped
out
of
bed
and
in
her
nightgown
a
freckled
bony
figure
in
curl
papers
padded
with
bare
feet
to
the
cupboard
who
told
you
you
might
she
asked
sternly
as
she
scrutinized
the
inside
of
the
cupboard
was
the
vodka
put
there
for
you
i
i
havent
drunk
vodka
but
paraffin
dashenka
muttered
strizhin
mopping
the
cold
sweat
on
his
brow
and
what
did
you
want
to
touch
the
paraffin
for
thats
nothing
to
do
with
you
is
it
is
it
put
there
for
you
or
do
you
suppose
paraffin
costs
nothing
eh
do
you
know
what
paraffin
is
now
do
you
know
dear
dashenka
moaned
strizhin
its
a
question
of
life
and
death
and
you
talk
about
money
hes
drunk
himself
tipsy
and
now
he
pokes
his
nose
into
the
cupboard
cried
dashenka
angrily
slamming
the
cupboard
door
oh
the
monsters
the
tormentors
im
a
martyr
a
miserable
woman
no
peace
day
or
night
vipers
basilisks
accursed
herods
may
you
suffer
the
same
in
the
world
to
come
i
am
going
to
morrow
i
am
a
maiden
lady
and
i
wont
allow
you
to
stand
before
me
in
your
underclothes
how
dare
you
look
at
me
when
i
am
not
dressed
and
she
went
on
and
on
knowing
that
when
dashenka
was
enraged
there
was
no
moving
her
with
prayers
or
vows
or
even
by
firing
a
cannon
strizhin
waved
his
hand
in
despair
dressed
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
doctor
but
a
doctor
is
only
readily
found
when
he
is
not
wanted
after
running
through
three
streets
and
ringing
five
times
at
dr
tchepharyantss
and
seven
times
at
dr
bultyhins
strizhin
raced
off
to
a
chemists
shop
thinking
possibly
the
chemist
could
help
him
there
after
a
long
interval
a
little
dark
and
curly
headed
chemist
came
out
to
him
in
his
dressing
gown
with
drowsy
eyes
and
such
a
wise
and
serious
face
that
it
was
positively
terrifying
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
tone
in
which
only
very
wise
and
dignified
chemists
of
jewish
persuasion
can
speak
for
gods
sake
i
entreat
you
said
strizhin
breathlessly
give
me
something
i
have
just
accidentally
drunk
paraffin
i
am
dying
i
beg
you
not
to
excite
yourself
and
to
answer
the
questions
i
am
about
to
put
to
you
the
very
fact
that
you
are
excited
prevents
me
from
understanding
you
you
have
drunk
paraffin
yes
yes
paraffin
please
save
me
the
chemist
went
coolly
and
gravely
to
the
desk
opened
a
book
became
absorbed
in
reading
it
after
reading
a
couple
of
pages
he
shrugged
one
shoulder
and
then
the
other
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
and
after
thinking
for
a
minute
went
into
the
adjoining
room
the
clock
struck
four
and
when
it
pointed
to
ten
minutes
past
the
chemist
came
back
with
another
book
and
again
plunged
into
reading
hm
he
said
as
though
puzzled
the
very
fact
that
you
feel
unwell
shows
you
ought
to
apply
to
a
doctor
not
a
chemist
but
i
have
been
to
the
doctors
already
i
could
not
ring
them
up
hm
you
dont
regard
us
chemists
as
human
beings
and
disturb
our
rest
even
at
four
oclock
at
night
though
every
dog
every
cat
can
rest
in
peace
you
dont
try
to
understand
anything
and
to
your
thinking
we
are
not
people
and
our
nerves
are
like
cords
strizhin
listened
to
the
chemist
heaved
a
sigh
and
went
home
so
i
am
fated
to
die
he
thought
and
in
his
mouth
was
a
burning
and
a
taste
of
paraffin
there
were
twinges
in
his
stomach
and
a
sound
of
boom
boom
boom
in
his
ears
every
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
end
was
near
that
his
heart
was
no
longer
beating
returning
home
he
made
haste
to
write
let
no
one
be
blamed
for
my
death
then
he
said
his
prayers
lay
down
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
his
head
he
lay
awake
till
morning
expecting
death
and
all
the
time
he
kept
fancying
how
his
grave
would
be
covered
with
fresh
green
grass
and
how
the
birds
would
twitter
over
it
and
in
the
morning
he
was
sitting
on
his
bed
saying
with
a
smile
to
dashenka
one
who
leads
a
steady
and
regular
life
dear
sister
is
unaffected
by
any
poison
take
me
for
example
i
have
been
on
the
verge
of
death
i
was
dying
and
in
agony
yet
now
i
am
all
right
there
is
only
a
burning
in
my
mouth
and
a
soreness
in
my
throat
but
i
am
all
right
all
over
thank
god
and
why
its
because
of
my
regular
life
no
its
because
its
inferior
paraffin
sighed
dashenka
thinking
of
the
household
expenses
and
gazing
into
space
the
man
at
the
shop
could
not
have
given
me
the
best
quality
but
that
at
three
farthings
i
am
a
martyr
i
am
a
miserable
woman
you
monsters
may
you
suffer
the
same
in
the
world
to
come
accursed
herods
and
she
went
on
and
on
