delight
that
lyubov

through
confinement
successfully
he
permitted
himself
drink
four
glasses
vodka
glass
wine
taste
which
suggested
something
midway
between
vinegar
castor
oil
spirituous
liquors
like
sea
water
glory
more
you
imbibe
them
greater
your
thirst
now
he

overwhelming
craving
drink

hesitation
overcoming
fears

off
immediately
something
like
miracle
took
place
strizhin
was
flung
back
from

chest
with
fearful
force
like

there
were
flashes
before

him
though
instead
vodka
he
swallowed
dynamite
which
blew
body
house
whole
street
head
arms
legs
seemed
torn
off
flying
away
somewhere
devil
into
space
some
three
minutes
he
lay
chest
not
moving
scarcely
breathing
then
he
got
asked

poisoned
himself
threw
him
into
cold
shiver
then
into
fever
that
it
was
really
poison
that
he
taken
was
proved
not
only
by
smell
room
but
also
by
burning
taste
mouth
flashes
before
eyes
ringing
head
colicky
pain
stomach
feeling
approach
death
not
buoying
himself
with
false
hopes

or
even
by

strizhin
waved
hand
despair
dressed
made
mind

through
three
streets
ringing
five
times
dr
tchepharyantss
seven
times
dr
bultyhins
strizhin
raced
off
chemists
shop
thinking
possibly
chemist
could
help
him
there
after
long
interval
little
dark
curly
headed
chemist
came
out
him
dressing
gown
with
drowsy
eyes
such
wise
serious
face
that
it
was
positively
terrifying
what
you
want
he
asked
tone
which
only
very
wise
dignified
chemists
jewish
persuasion
speak
gods
sake
i
entreat
you
said
strizhin
breathlessly
give
me
something
i
just
accidentally
drunk
paraffin
i
dying
i
beg
you
not
excite
yourself
answer
questions
i
about
put
you
very
fact
that
you
excited
prevents
me
from
understanding
you
you
drunk
paraffin
yes
yes
paraffin
please
save
me
chemist
went
coolly
gravely
desk
opened
book
became
absorbed
reading
it
after
reading
couple
pages
he
shrugged
one
shoulder
then
other
made
contemptuous
grimace
after
thinking
minute
went
into
adjoining
room
clock
struck
four
when
it
pointed
ten
minutes
past
chemist
came
back
with
another
book
again
plunged
into
reading
hm
he
said
though
puzzled
very
fact
that
you
feel
unwell
shows
you
ought
apply
doctor
not
chemist
but
i
been
doctors
already
i
could
not
ring
them
hm
you
dont
regard
us
chemists
human
beings
disturb
our
rest
even
four
oclock
night
though
every
dog
every
cat
rest
peace
you
dont
try
understand
anything
your
thinking
not
people
our
nerves
like
cords
strizhin
listened
chemist
heaved
sigh
went
home
so
i
fated
die
he
thought
mouth
was
burning
taste
paraffin
there
were
twinges
stomach
sound
boom
boom
boom
ears
every
moment
it
seemed
him
that
end
was
near
that
heart
was
longer
beating
returning
home
he
made
haste
write
let
one
blamed
my
death
then
he
said
prayers
lay
down
pulled
bedclothes
over
head
he
lay
awake
till
morning
expecting
death
time
he
kept
fancying
how
grave
would
covered
with
fresh
green
grass
how
birds
would
twitter
over
it
morning
he
was
sitting
bed
saying
with
smile
dashenka
one
who
leads
steady
regular
life
dear
sister
unaffected
by
any
poison

i
right
there
only
burning

throat
