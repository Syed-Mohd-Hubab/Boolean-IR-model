nina
ivanovna
assuming
very
serious
even
severe
expression
but
i
must
own
that
there
much
that
mysterious
incomprehensible
nature
i
quite
agree
with
you
though
i
must
add
that
religion
distinctly
curtails
us
domain
mysterious
big
very
fat

far
away
she
was
not
sleepy

very
soft
uncomfortable
nadya
sat
bed
fell
thinking
she
done
every
night
may
thoughts
were
same
they
been
night
before
useless
persistent
thoughts
always
alike
how
andrey
andreitch
begun
courting
made
an
offer
how
she
accepted
him
then
little
by
little
come
appreciate
kindly
intelligent
man
but
some
reason
now
when
there
was
hardly
month
left
before
wedding
she
began
feel
dread
uneasiness
though
something
vague
oppressive
were
before
tick
tock
tick
tock
watchman
tapped
lazily
tick
tock
through
big
old
fashioned
window
she
could
see
garden
little
distance
bushes
lilac
full
flower
drowsy
lifeless
from
cold
thick
white
mist
was
floating
softly
lilac
trying
cover
it
drowsy
rooks
were
cawing
far
away
trees
my
god
why
my
heart
so
heavy
perhaps
every
girl
felt
same
before
wedding
there
was
knowing
or
was
it
sashas
influence
but
several
years
past
sasha
been
repeating
same
thing
like
copybook
when
he
talked
he
seemed
nave
queer
but
why
was
it
she
could
not
get
sasha
out
head
why
was
it
watchman
left
off
tapping
long
while
birds
were
twittering
under
windows
mist
disappeared
from
garden
everything
was
lighted
by
spring
sunshine
by
smile
soon
whole
garden
warm
caressed
by
sun
returned
life
dewdrops
like
diamonds
glittered
leaves
old
neglected
garden
that
morning
looked
young
gaily

great
deal

doubts
which
she
was
subject
nadya
it
seemed
though
there
were
deep
mysterious
significance
that
now
nadya
kissed
mother

beside
what
you

crying
about
mother
she
asked

there
was
passage
which
made
it
hard
keep
from
tears
said
nina
ivanovna
she
sipped
glass
i
thought
it
this
morning
shed
tears
again

nadya
after
pause
why

i
shut
my
eyes
very
tightly
like

anna
karenin
moving
about

or
something
historical
from

world
nadya
felt
that
mother
did
not
understand
was
incapable
understanding
she
felt
this
first
time

it
positively
frightened
made
want
hide
herself

vegetable
soup
he
was
making
jokes
through
dinner
time
but
jests
were
laboured
invariably
with
moral
bearing
effect
was
not
amusing
when
before
making
some
witty
remark
he
raised
very
long
thin
deathly
looking
fingers
when
one
remembered
that
he
was
very
ill
would
probably
not
much
longer
this
world
one
felt
sorry
him
ready
weep
after
dinner
granny
went
off
own

she
was
sitting
far
back
an
old

armchair
with
eyes
shut
while
he
paced
slowly
about
room
from
corner
corner
if
only
you
would
go

he
said
only
enlightened
holy
people
interesting
its
only
they
who

people
there
sooner

though
by
magic
then
there
will
immense
magnificent
houses
here
wonderful
gardens
marvellous
fountains
remarkable
people
but
thats
not
what

most
what
matters
most
that
crowd
our
sense
word
sense
which
it
exists
now
that
evil
will
not
exist
then
because
every
man
will
believe
every

evening
andrey
andreitch
arrived
usual
played
fiddle
long
time
he
was
not

woman
between

so
small
so
pitiful
so
foolish
nadya
went
room
dressed
sitting
window
fell
waiting
morning
she
sat
night
thinking
while
someone
seemed
tapping
shutters
whistling
yard
morning
granny

after

nadya
went
into
sashas
room
without

knelt
down
before
an
armchair
corner
hid
face
hands
what
it
asked
sasha

with

though
he
were
dancing
with
delight
splendid
he
said
rubbing
hands
my
goodness
how
fine
that
she
stared
him
without
bblinking
with
adoring
eyes
though
spellbound
expecting
every
minute
that
he
would
say
something
important
something
infinitely
significant
he
told
nothing
yet
but
already
it
seemed
that
something
new
great
was
opening
before
which
she
not
known
till
then
already
she
gazed
him
full
expectation
ready
face

that

very
much
excited
that
heart

heavier
than
ever
before
that
she
would
spend
time
till
she

she
not
really
believed
when
she
was
saying
good

granny
when
she
was

she
suddenly
thought
it
andrey
father
new
house
naked
lady
with
vase
it
longer
frightened
nor
weighed
upon
but
was
nave
trivial
continually
retreated
further
away
when
they
got
into
railway
carriage
train
began
move
that
past
which
been
so
big
serious
shrank
into
something
tiny
vast
wide
future
which
till
then
scarcely
been
noticed
began
unfolding
before
rain
pattered
carriage
windows
nothing
could
seen
but
green
fields
telegraph
posts
with
birds
sitting
wires
flitted
by
joy
made
hold
breath
she
thought
that
she
was
going
freedom
going
study
this
was
just
like
what
used
ages

sasha
smiling
its
right
vi

very
homesick
thought
every
day
mother
grandmother
she
thought
sasha
too
letters

it
seemed
though

she
set
off

good
health
high
spirits
stopped
way
moscow

beard
unkempt
hair
with
same
large
beautiful
eyes
he
still
wore
same
coat
canvas
trousers
but
he
looked
unwell
worried
he
seemed
both
older
thinner
kept
coughing
some
reason
he
struck
nadya
grey
provincial
my
god
nadya
come
he
said
laughed
gaily
my

girl
they
sat
printing
room
which
was
full

it
there
were
masses
dead
flies
table
floor
everything
showed
that
sasha
ordered
personal
life
slovenly
way
lived
anyhow
with
utter
contempt
comfort
if
anyone
began
talking
him
personal
happiness
personal
life
affection
him
he
would
not

would
only
laughed

cheerful
but
he
kept
coughing

nadya
kept
looking

unable
decide
whether

she
said

she
said
tears
gushed
from
eyes
some
reason
there
rose
before
imagination
andrey
andreitch
naked
lady
with
vase
past
which
seemed
now
far
away
childhood
she
began
crying
because
sasha

they
drove

apples
when
train
began
moving
he
waved
handkerchief
smiling
it
could
seen
even
from
legs
that
he
was
very
ill

not
live
long
nadya
reached
native
town
midday
she
drove
home
from

streets
struck
very
wide
houses
very
small
squat
there

rusty
greatcoat
houses
looked
though
they
were
covered
with
dust
granny
who
seemed
grown
quite
old
but
was
fat
plain
ever
flung
arms
round
nadya
cried
long
time
with
face
nadyas
shoulder
unable
tear
herself
away
nina
ivanovna
looked
much
older
plainer
seemed
shrivelled
but
was
still
tightly
laced
still
diamonds
flashing
fingers
my
darling
she
said
trembling
over
my
darling
then
they
sat
down
cried
without
speaking
it
was
evident
that
both
mother
grandmother
realized
that
past
was
lost
gone
never
return
they
now
position
society
prestige
before
right
invite
visitors
so
it
when

an
easy
careless
life

turns
out
that
head
family
embezzled
money
or
committed

gay
noisy
bathed
sunshine
she
touched
