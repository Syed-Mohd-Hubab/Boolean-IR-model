then
bent

who
forced
from

about

indeed
what
did
that
speech
amount
instructions
from
superiors

with
long
established
routine
he
would
fire
it
off

prisoner
turned
pale
coughed
nervously
into

but
soon
stillness
general
monotony
boredom
infected
him
too
he
looked
with
dull
witted
respectfulness
judges

weary
faces
jurymen
bblinked
calmly
surroundings
procedure
court
expectation
which
so
weighed
soul
while
he
was
awaiting
them
prison
now
most
soothing
effect
him
what
he
met
here
was
not
what
he
could
expected
charge
murder
hung
over
him
yet
here
he
met
with
neither
threatening
faces
nor
indignant
looks
nor
loud
phrases
about
retribution
nor
sympathy
extraordinary
fate
not
one
those
who
were
judging
him
looked
him
with
interest
or
long
dingy
windows
walls
voice
secretary
attitude
prosecutor
were
saturated
with
official
indifference
produced
an
atmosphere
frigidity
though
murderer
were
simply
an
official
property
or
though
he
were
not
being
judged
by
living
men
but
by
some
unseen
machine
set
going
goodness
knows
how
or
by
whom

reassured
did
not
understand
that
men
here
were
accustomed
dramas
tragedies
life
were
blunted
by
sight
them
hospital
attendants
sight
death
that
whole
horror
hopelessness
position
lay
just
this
mechanical
indifference
it
seemed
that
if
he
were
not
sit
quietly
but
get
begin
beseeching
appealing
with
tears
their
mercy
bitterly
repenting
that
if
he
were
die
despairit
would
shattered
against
blunted
nerves
callousness
custom
like
waves
against
rock
when
secretary
finished
president
some
reason
passed
hands
over
table
before
him
looked
some
time
with

screwed
towards

negatively
without
lifting
eyes
from
cain
counsel
defence
unexpectedly
stirred
clearing
throat
asked
tell
me
doctor
you
from
dimensions
wound
form
any
theory
mental
condition

president
raised
drowsy
indifferent
eyes
counsel
defence
assistant
prosecutor
tore
himself
from
cain

but
there
was
smile
surprise
perplexitytheir
faces
expressed
nothing
perhaps
doctor
hesitated
if
one
considers
force
with
which
ererer
criminal
strikes
blow
however
excuse
me
i
dont
quite
understand
your
question
counsel
defence
did
not
get
an
answer
question
indeed
he
did
not
feel
necessity
one
it
was
clear
even
himself
that
that
question
strayed
into
mind
found
utterance
simply
through
effect
stillness
boredom
whirring
ventilator
wheels
when
they
got
rid
doctor
court
rose
examine
material

through
every
head
court
thought
possibly
fatal
coincidence
not

raised
their
heads
trying

with
their
work
