duel
flashed
through
sigaevs
mind
its
doing
him
too
much
honour

killed
like
dogs
shopman
swaying
gracefully
tripping
fro
little
feet
still
smiling
chattering
displayed
before
him
heap
revolvers
most
inviting
impressive
was
smith
wessons
sigaev
picked
pistol
that
pattern
gazed
blankly
it
sank
into
brooding
imagination
pictured
how
he
would
blow
out
their
brains
how
blood
would
flow
streams
over
rug
parquet
how
traitresss
legs
would
twitch
last
agony
but
that
was
not
enough
indignant
soul
picture
blood
wailing
horror
did
not
satisfy
him
he
must
think
something
more
terrible
i
know
ill
kill
myself
him
he
thought
but
ill
leave
alive
let
pine
away
from
stings
conscience
contempt
surrounding
sensitive
nature
like
hers
that
will
far
more
agonizing
than
death
he
imagined
own
funeral
he
injured
husband
lies
coffin
with
gentle
smile
lips
she
pale
tortured
by
remorse
follows
coffin
like
niobe
not
knowing
where
hide
herself
escape
from
withering
contemptuous
looks
cast
upon
by
indignant
crowd
i
see
msieu
that
you
like
smith
wesson
make
shopman
broke
upon
broodings
if
you
think
it
too
dear
very
well
ill

off
five
roubles
but
other
makes
cheaper
little
frenchified
figure
turned
gracefully
took
down
another
dozen
cases
revolvers
from
shelf
here
msieu
price
thirty
roubles
thats
not
expensive
especially
rate
exchange
dropped
terribly
customs
duties
rising
every
hour
msieu
i
vow
i
conservative
but
even
i
beginning
murmur
why
with
rate
exchange
customs
tariff
only
rich
purchase
firearms
theres
nothing
left
poor
but
tula
weapons
phosphorus
matches
tula
weapons
misery
you
may
aim
your
wife
with
tula
revolver
shoot
yourself
through
shoulder
blade
sigaev
suddenly
felt
mortified
sorry
that
he
would
dead
would
miss
seeing
agonies
traitress
revenge
only
sweet
when
one
see
taste
its
fruits
what
sense
would
there
it
if
he
were
lying
coffin
knowing
nothing
about
it
hadnt
i
better
this
he
pondered
ill
kill
him
then
ill
go
funeral
look
after
funeral
ill
kill
myself
theyd
arrest
me
though
before
funeral
take
away
my
pistol
so
ill
kill
him
she
shall
remain
alive
i
time
ill
not
kill
myself
but
go
arrested
i
shall
always
time
kill
myself
there
will
this
advantage
about
being
arrested
that
preliminary
investigation
i
shall
an
opportunity
exposing
authorities
public
infamy
conduct
if
i
kill
myself
she
may
with
characteristic
duplicity
impudence
throw
blame
me
society
will
justify
behaviour
will
very
likely
laugh
me
if
i
remain
alive
then
minute
later
he
was
thinking
yes
if
i
kill
myself
i
may
blamed
suspected
petty
feeling
besides
why
should
i
kill
myself
thats
one
thing
another
shoot
oneself
cowardly
so
ill
kill
him
let
live
ill
face
my
trial
i
shall
tried
she
will
brought
into
court
witness
i
imagine
confusion
disgrace
when
she
examined
by
my
counsel
sympathies
court
press
public
will
certainly
with
me
while
he
deliberated
shopman
displayed
wares
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
entertain
customer
here
english
ones
new
pattern
only
just
received
he
prattled
but
i
warn
you
