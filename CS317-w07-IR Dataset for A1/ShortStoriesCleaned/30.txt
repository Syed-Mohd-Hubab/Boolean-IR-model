little
man
told
us
following
story
i
was
not
more
than
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
when
i
fell
head
over
ears
love
with
my
present
wife
made
an
offer
now
i
could
with
pleasure
thrash
myself
my
early
marriage
but
time
i
dont
know
what
would
become
me
if
natasha
refused
me
my
love
was
absolutely
real
thing
just
it
described
novels
frantic
passionate
so
my
happiness
overwhelmed
me
i
did
not
know
how
get
away
from
it
i
bored
my
father
my
friends
servants
continually
talking
about
fervour
my
passion
happy
people
most
sickening
bores
i
was
fearful
bore
i
feel
ashamed
it
even
now
among
my
friends
there
was
those
days
young
man
who
was
beginning
career
lawyer
now
he
lawyer
known
over
russia
those
days
he
was
only
just
beginning
gain
recognition
was
not
rich
famous
enough
entitled
cut
an
old
friend
when
he
met
him
i
used
go
see
him
or
twice
week
used
loll
sofas
begin
discussing
philosophy
one
day
i
was
lying
sofa
arguing
that
there
was
more
ungrateful
profession
than
that
lawyer
i
tried
prove
that
soon
examination
witnesses
over
court
easily
dispense
with
both
counsels
prosecution
defence
because
they
neither
them
necessary
only
way
if
grown
juryman
morally
mentally
sane
convinced
that
ceiling
white
or
that
ivanov
guilty
struggle
with
that
conviction
vanquish
it
beyond
power
any
demosthenes
who
convince
me
that
i
red
moustache
when
i
know
that
it
black
i
listen
an
orator
i
may
perhaps
grow
sentimental
weep
but
my
fundamental
conviction
based
most
part
unmistakable
evidence
fact
not
changed
least
my
lawyer
maintained
that
i
was
young
foolish
that
i
was
talking
childish
nonsense
opinion
one
thing
an
obvious
fact
becomes
still
more
obvious
through
light
being
thrown
upon
it
by
conscientious
well
informed
people
another
talent
an
elemental
force
hurricane
capable
turning
even
stones
dust
let
alone
such
trifles
convictions
artisans
merchants
second
guild
it
hard
human
weakness
struggle
against
talent
look
sun
without
winking
or
stop
wind
one
simple
mortal
by
power
word
turns
thousands
convinced
savages
christianity
odysseus
was
man
firmest
convictions
but
he
succumbed
syrens
so
history
consists
similar
examples
life
they
met
with
every
turn
so
it
bound
or
intelligent
talented
man
would
superiority
over
stupid
incompetent
i
stuck
my
point
went
maintaining
that
convictions
stronger
than
any
talent
though
frankly
speaking
i
could
not
defined
exactly
what
i
meant
by
conviction
or
what
i
meant
by
talent
most
likely
i
simply
talked
sake
talking
take
you
example
said
lawyer
you
convinced
this
moment
that
your
fiance
an
angel
that
there
not
man
whole
town
happier
than
you
but
i
tell
you
ten
or
twenty
minutes
would
enough
me
make
you
sit
down
this
table
write
your
fiance
breaking
off
your
engagement
i
laughed
dont
laugh
i
speaking
seriously
said
my
friend
if
i
choose
twenty
minutes
you
will
happy
thought
that
you
need
not
get
married
goodness
knows
what
talent
i
but
you
not
one
strong
sort
well
try
it
said
i
what
i
only
telling
you
this
you
good
boy
it
would
cruel
subject
you
such
an
experiment
besides
i
not
good
form
day
sat
down
supper
wine
thought
natasha
my
beloved
flooded
my
whole
being
with
youth
happiness
my
happiness
was
so
boundless
that
lawyer
sitting
opposite
me
with
green
eyes
seemed
me
an
unhappy
man
so
small
so
grey
try
i
persisted
come
i
entreat
you
lawyer
shook
head
frowned
evidently
i
was
beginning
bore
him
i
know
he
said
after
my
experiment
you
will
say
thank
you
will
call
me
your
saviour
but
you
see
i
must
think
your
fiance
too
she
loves
you
your
jilting
would
make
suffer
what
charming
creature
she
i
envy
you
lawyer
sighed
sipped
wine
began
talking
how
charming
my
natasha
was
he
an
extraordinary
gift
description
he
could
knock
you
off
regular
string
words
about
womans
eyelashes
or
little
finger
i
listened
him
with
relish
i
seen
great
many
women
my
day
he
said
but
i
give
you
my
word
honour
i
speak
friend
your
natasha
andreyevna
pearl
rare
girl
course
she
defects
many
them
fact
if
you
like
but
still
she
fascinating
lawyer
began
talking
my
fiances
defects
now
i
understand
very
well
that
he
was
talking
women
general
their
weak
points
general
but
time
it
seemed
me
that
he
was
talking
only
natasha
he
went
into
ecstasies
over
turn
nose
shrieks
shrill
laugh
airs
graces
precisely
things
i
so
disliked
that
was
thinking
infinitely
sweet
graceful
feminine
without
my
noticing
it
he
quickly
passed
from
enthusiastic
tone
one
fatherly
admonition
then
light
derisive
one
there
was
presiding
judge
one
check
diffusiveness
lawyer
i
not
time
open
my
mouth
besides
what
could
i
say
what
my
friend
said
was
not
new
it
was
what
everyone
known
ages
whole
venom
lay
not
what
he
said
but
damnable
form
he
put
it
it
really
was
beyond
anything
i
listened
him
then
i
learned
that
same
word
thousands
shades
meaning
according
tone
which
it
pronounced
form
which
given
sentence
course
i
cannot
reproduce
tone
or
form
i
only
say
that
i
listened
my
friend
walked
down
room
i
was
moved
resentment
indignation
contempt
together
with
him
i
even
believed
him
when
with
tears
eyes
he
informed
me
that
i
was
great
man
that
i
was
worthy
better
fate
that
i
was
destined
achieve
something
future
which
marriage
would
hinder
my
friend
he
exclaimed
pressing
my
hand
i
beseech
you
i
adjure
you
stop
before
it
too
late
stop
may
heaven
preserve
you
from
this
strange
cruel
mistake
my
friend
not
ruin
your
youth
believe
me
or
not
you
choose
but
long
short
it
was
that
i
sat
down
table
wrote
my
fiance
breaking
off
engagement
i
wrote
i
felt
relieved
that
it
was
not

visions
haunting
him
jurymen
suddenly
forgot
about
strong
impressions
