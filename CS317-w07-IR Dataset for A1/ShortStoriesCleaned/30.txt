strong
impressions
it
happened
not
so
long
ago
in
the
moscow
circuit
court
the
jurymen
left
in
the
court
for
the
night
before
lying
down
to
sleep
fell
into
conversation
about
strong
impressions
they
were
led
to
this
discussion
by
recalling
a
witness
who
by
his
own
account
had
begun
to
stammer
and
had
gone
grey
owing
to
a
terrible
moment
the
jurymen
decided
that
before
going
to
sleep
each
one
of
them
should
ransack
among
his
memories
and
tell
something
that
had
happened
to
him
mans
life
is
brief
but
yet
there
is
no
man
who
cannot
boast
that
there
have
been
terrible
moments
in
his
past
one
juryman
told
the
story
of
how
he
was
nearly
drowned
another
described
how
in
a
place
where
there
were
neither
doctors
nor
chemists
he
had
one
night
poisoned
his
own
son
through
giving
him
zinc
vitriol
by
mistake
for
soda
the
child
did
not
die
but
the
father
nearly
went
out
of
his
mind
a
third
a
man
not
old
but
in
bad
health
told
how
he
had
twice
attempted
to
commit
suicide
the
first
time
by
shooting
himself
and
the
second
time
by
throwing
himself
before
a
train
the
fourth
a
foppishly
dressed
fat
little
man
told
us
the
following
story
i
was
not
more
than
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
when
i
fell
head
over
ears
in
love
with
my
present
wife
and
made
her
an
offer
now
i
could
with
pleasure
thrash
myself
for
my
early
marriage
but
at
the
time
i
dont
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
natasha
had
refused
me
my
love
was
absolutely
the
real
thing
just
as
it
is
described
in
novelsfrantic
passionate
and
so
on
my
happiness
overwhelmed
me
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
get
away
from
it
and
i
bored
my
father
and
my
friends
and
the
servants
continually
talking
about
the
fervour
of
my
passion
happy
people
are
the
most
sickening
bores
i
was
a
fearful
bore
i
feel
ashamed
of
it
even
now
among
my
friends
there
was
in
those
days
a
young
man
who
was
beginning
his
career
as
a
lawyer
now
he
is
a
lawyer
known
all
over
russia
in
those
days
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
gain
recognition
and
was
not
rich
and
famous
enough
to
be
entitled
to
cut
an
old
friend
when
he
met
him
i
used
to
go
and
see
him
once
or
twice
a
week
we
used
to
loll
on
sofas
and
begin
discussing
philosophy
one
day
i
was
lying
on
his
sofa
arguing
that
there
was
no
more
ungrateful
profession
than
that
of
a
lawyer
i
tried
to
prove
that
as
soon
as
the
examination
of
witnesses
is
over
the
court
can
easily
dispense
with
both
the
counsels
for
the
prosecution
and
for
the
defence
because
they
are
neither
of
them
necessary
and
are
only
in
the
way
if
a
grown
up
juryman
morally
and
mentally
sane
is
convinced
that
the
ceiling
is
white
or
that
ivanov
is
guilty
to
struggle
with
that
conviction
and
to
vanquish
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
any
demosthenes
who
can
convince
me
that
i
have
a
red
moustache
when
i
know
that
it
is
black
as
i
listen
to
an
orator
i
may
perhaps
grow
sentimental
and
weep
but
my
fundamental
conviction
based
for
the
most
part
on
unmistakable
evidence
and
fact
is
not
changed
in
the
least
my
lawyer
maintained
that
i
was
young
and
foolish
and
that
i
was
talking
childish
nonsense
in
his
opinion
for
one
thing
an
obvious
fact
becomes
still
more
obvious
through
light
being
thrown
upon
it
by
conscientious
well
informed
people
for
another
talent
is
an
elemental
force
a
hurricane
capable
of
turning
even
stones
to
dust
let
alone
such
trifles
as
the
convictions
of
artisans
and
merchants
of
the
second
guild
it
is
as
hard
for
human
weakness
to
struggle
against
talent
as
to
look
at
the
sun
without
winking
or
to
stop
the
wind
one
simple
mortal
by
the
power
of
the
word
turns
thousands
of
convinced
savages
to
christianity
odysseus
was
a
man
of
the
firmest
convictions
but
he
succumbed
to
the
syrens
and
so
on
all
history
consists
of
similar
examples
and
in
life
they
are
met
with
at
every
turn
and
so
it
is
bound
to
be
or
the
intelligent
and
talented
man
would
have
no
superiority
over
the
stupid
and
incompetent
i
stuck
to
my
point
and
went
on
maintaining
that
convictions
are
stronger
than
any
talent
though
frankly
speaking
i
could
not
have
defined
exactly
what
i
meant
by
conviction
or
what
i
meant
by
talent
most
likely
i
simply
talked
for
the
sake
of
talking
take
you
for
example
said
the
lawyer
you
are
convinced
at
this
moment
that
your
fiance
is
an
angel
and
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
whole
town
happier
than
you
but
i
tell
you
ten
or
twenty
minutes
would
be
enough
for
me
to
make
you
sit
down
to
this
table
and
write
to
your
fiance
breaking
off
your
engagement
i
laughed
dont
laugh
i
am
speaking
seriously
said
my
friend
if
i
choose
in
twenty
minutes
you
will
be
happy
at
the
thought
that
you
need
not
get
married
goodness
knows
what
talent
i
have
but
you
are
not
one
of
the
strong
sort
well
try
it
on
said
i
no
what
for
i
am
only
telling
you
this
you
are
a
good
boy
and
it
would
be
cruel
to
subject
you
to
such
an
experiment
and
besides
i
am
not
in
good
form
to
day
we
sat
down
to
supper
the
wine
and
the
thought
of
natasha
my
beloved
flooded
my
whole
being
with
youth
and
happiness
my
happiness
was
so
boundless
that
the
lawyer
sitting
opposite
to
me
with
his
green
eyes
seemed
to
me
an
unhappy
man
so
small
so
grey
do
try
i
persisted
come
i
entreat
you
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
and
frowned
evidently
i
was
beginning
to
bore
him
i
know
he
said
after
my
experiment
you
will
say
thank
you
and
will
call
me
your
saviour
but
you
see
i
must
think
of
your
fiance
too
she
loves
you
your
jilting
her
would
make
her
suffer
and
what
a
charming
creature
she
is
i
envy
you
the
lawyer
sighed
sipped
his
wine
and
began
talking
of
how
charming
my
natasha
was
he
had
an
extraordinary
gift
of
description
he
could
knock
you
off
a
regular
string
of
words
about
a
womans
eyelashes
or
her
little
finger
i
listened
to
him
with
relish
i
have
seen
a
great
many
women
in
my
day
he
said
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
speak
as
a
friend
your
natasha
andreyevna
is
a
pearl
a
rare
girl
of
course
she
has
her
defectsmany
of
them
in
fact
if
you
likebut
still
she
is
fascinating
and
the
lawyer
began
talking
of
my
fiances
defects
now
i
understand
very
well
that
he
was
talking
of
women
in
general
of
their
weak
points
in
general
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
talking
only
of
natasha
he
went
into
ecstasies
over
her
turn
up
nose
her
shrieks
her
shrill
laugh
her
airs
and
graces
precisely
all
the
things
i
so
disliked
in
her
all
that
was
to
his
thinking
infinitely
sweet
graceful
and
feminine
without
my
noticing
it
he
quickly
passed
from
his
enthusiastic
tone
to
one
of
fatherly
admonition
and
then
to
a
light
and
derisive
one
there
was
no
presiding
judge
and
no
one
to
check
the
diffusiveness
of
the
lawyer
i
had
not
time
to
open
my
mouth
besides
what
could
i
say
what
my
friend
said
was
not
new
it
was
what
everyone
has
known
for
ages
and
the
whole
venom
lay
not
in
what
he
said
but
in
the
damnable
form
he
put
it
in
it
really
was
beyond
anything
as
i
listened
to
him
then
i
learned
that
the
same
word
has
thousands
of
shades
of
meaning
according
to
the
tone
in
which
it
is
pronounced
and
the
form
which
is
given
to
the
sentence
of
course
i
cannot
reproduce
the
tone
or
the
form
i
can
only
say
that
as
i
listened
to
my
friend
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
i
was
moved
to
resentment
indignation
and
contempt
together
with
him
i
even
believed
him
when
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
informed
me
that
i
was
a
great
man
that
i
was
worthy
of
a
better
fate
that
i
was
destined
to
achieve
something
in
the
future
which
marriage
would
hinder
my
friend
he
exclaimed
pressing
my
hand
i
beseech
you
i
adjure
you
stop
before
it
is
too
late
stop
may
heaven
preserve
you
from
this
strange
cruel
mistake
my
friend
do
not
ruin
your
youth
believe
me
or
not
as
you
choose
but
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
i
sat
down
to
the
table
and
wrote
to
my
fiance
breaking
off
the
engagement
as
i
wrote
i
felt
relieved
that
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
rectify
my
mistake
sealing
the
letter
i
hastened
out
into
the
street
to
post
it
the
lawyer
himself
came
with
me
excellent
capital
he
applauded
me
as
my
letter
to
natasha
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
box
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
i
am
glad
for
you
after
walking
a
dozen
paces
with
me
the
lawyer
went
on
of
course
marriage
has
its
good
points
i
for
instance
belong
to
the
class
of
people
to
whom
marriage
and
home
life
is
everything
and
he
proceeded
to
describe
his
life
and
lay
before
me
all
the
hideousness
of
a
solitary
bachelor
existence
he
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
future
wife
of
the
sweets
of
ordinary
family
life
and
was
so
eloquent
so
sincere
in
his
ecstasies
that
by
the
time
we
had
reached
his
door
i
was
in
despair
what
are
you
doing
to
me
you
horrible
man
i
said
gasping
you
have
ruined
me
why
did
you
make
me
write
that
cursed
letter
i
love
her
i
love
her
and
i
protested
my
love
i
was
horrified
at
my
conduct
which
now
seemed
to
me
wild
and
senseless
it
is
impossible
gentlemen
to
imagine
a
more
violent
emotion
than
i
experienced
at
that
moment
oh
what
i
went
through
what
i
suffered
if
some
kind
person
had
thrust
a
revolver
into
my
hand
at
that
moment
i
should
have
put
a
bullet
through
my
brains
with
pleasure
come
come
said
the
lawyer
slapping
me
on
the
shoulder
and
he
laughed
give
over
crying
the
letter
wont
reach
your
fiance
it
was
not
you
who
wrote
the
address
but
i
and
i
muddled
it
so
they
wont
be
able
to
make
it
out
at
the
post
office
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
not
to
argue
about
what
you
dont
understand
now
gentlemen
i
leave
it
to
the
next
to
speak
the
fifth
juryman
settled
himself
more
comfortably
and
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
begin
his
story
when
we
heard
the
clock
strike
on
spassky
tower
twelve
one
of
the
jurymen
counted
and
into
which
class
gentlemen
would
you
put
the
emotions
that
are
being
experienced
now
by
the
man
we
are
trying
he
that
murderer
is
spending
the
night
in
a
convict
cell
here
in
the
court
sitting
or
lying
down
and
of
course
not
sleeping
and
throughout
the
whole
sleepless
night
listening
to
that
chime
what
is
he
thinking
of
what
visions
are
haunting
him
and
the
jurymen
all
suddenly
forgot
about
strong
impressions
what
their
companion
who
had
once
written
a
letter
to
his
natasha
had
suffered
seemed
unimportant
even
not
amusing
and
no
one
said
anything
more
they
began
quietly
and
in
silence
lying
down
to
sleep
