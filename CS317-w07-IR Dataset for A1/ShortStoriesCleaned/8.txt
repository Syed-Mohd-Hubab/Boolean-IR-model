here
olga
he
said
take
this
gentleman
shed
let
him
chop
some
wood
beggar
shrugged
shoulders
though
puzzled
irresolutely
followed
cook
it
was
evident
from
demeanour
that
he
consented
go
chop
wood
not
because
he
was
hungry
wanted
earn
money
but
simply
from
shame
amour
propre
because
he
been
taken
word
it
was
clear
too
that
he
was
suffering
from
effects
vodka
that
he
was
unwell
felt
not
faintest
inclination
work
skvortsov
hurried
into
dining
room
there
from

which
looked
out
into

into
thought
cook
flung
an

judging
by
expression

across
it

toppled
fell
over
beggar
drew
it
towards

cautiously
though
he
were
afraid
its
hitting
golosh
or
chopping
off
fingers
log
fell
over
again
skvortsovs
wrath
passed
off
by
now
