the
examining
magistrate
a
district
doctor
and
an
examining
magistrate
were
driving
one
fine
spring
day
to
an
inquest
the
examining
magistrate
a
man
of
five
and
thirty
looked
dreamily
at
the
horses
and
said
there
is
a
great
deal
that
is
enigmatic
and
obscure
in
nature
and
even
in
everyday
life
doctor
one
must
often
come
upon
phenomena
which
are
absolutely
incapable
of
explanation
i
know
for
instance
of
several
strange
mysterious
deaths
the
cause
of
which
only
spiritualists
and
mystics
will
undertake
to
explain
a
clearheaded
man
can
only
lift
up
his
hands
in
perplexity
for
example
i
know
of
a
highly
cultured
lady
who
foretold
her
own
death
and
died
without
any
apparent
reason
on
the
very
day
she
had
predicted
she
said
that
she
would
die
on
a
certain
day
and
she
did
die
theres
no
effect
without
a
cause
said
the
doctor
if
theres
a
death
there
must
be
a
cause
for
it
but
as
for
predicting
it
theres
nothing
very
marvellous
in
that
all
our
ladiesall
our
females
in
facthave
a
turn
for
prophecies
and
presentiments
just
so
but
my
lady
doctor
was
quite
a
special
case
there
was
nothing
like
the
ladies
or
other
females
presentiments
about
her
prediction
and
her
death
she
was
a
young
woman
healthy
and
clever
with
no
superstitions
of
any
sort
she
had
such
clear
intelligent
honest
eyes
an
open
sensible
face
with
a
faint
typically
russian
look
of
mockery
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
there
was
nothing
of
the
fine
lady
or
of
the
female
about
her
exceptif
you
like
her
beauty
she
was
graceful
elegant
as
that
birch
tree
she
had
wonderful
hair
that
she
may
be
intelligible
to
you
i
will
add
too
that
she
was
a
person
of
the
most
infectious
gaiety
and
carelessness
and
that
intelligent
good
sort
of
frivolity
which
is
only
found
in
goodnatured
lighthearted
people
with
brains
can
one
talk
of
mysticism
spiritualism
a
turn
for
presentiment
or
anything
of
that
sort
in
this
case
she
used
to
laugh
at
all
that
the
doctors
chaise
stopped
by
a
well
the
examining
magistrate
and
the
doctor
drank
some
water
stretched
and
waited
for
the
coachman
to
finish
watering
the
horses
well
what
did
the
lady
die
of
asked
the
doctor
when
the
chaise
was
rolling
along
the
road
again
she
died
in
a
strange
way
one
fine
day
her
husband
went
in
to
her
and
said
that
it
wouldnt
be
amiss
to
sell
their
old
coach
before
the
spring
and
to
buy
something
rather
newer
and
lighter
instead
and
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
change
the
left
trace
horse
and
to
put
bobtchinsky
that
was
the
name
of
one
of
her
husbands
horses
in
the
shafts
his
wife
listened
to
him
and
said
do
as
you
think
best
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
now
before
the
summer
i
shall
be
in
the
cemetery
her
husband
of
course
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
i
am
not
joking
she
said
i
tell
you
in
earnest
that
i
shall
soon
be
dead
what
do
you
mean
by
soon
directly
after
my
confinement
i
shall
bear
my
child
and
die
the
husband
attached
no
significance
to
these
words
he
did
not
believe
in
presentiments
of
any
sort
and
he
knew
that
ladies
in
an
interesting
condition
are
apt
to
be
fanciful
and
to
give
way
to
gloomy
ideas
generally
a
day
later
his
wife
spoke
to
him
again
of
dying
immediately
after
her
confinement
and
then
every
day
she
spoke
of
it
and
he
laughed
and
called
her
a
silly
woman
a
fortuneteller
a
crazy
creature
her
approaching
death
became
an
ide
fix
with
his
wife
when
her
husband
would
not
listen
to
her
she
would
go
into
the
kitchen
and
talk
of
her
death
to
the
nurse
and
the
cook
i
havent
long
to
live
now
nurse
she
would
say
as
soon
as
my
confinement
is
over
i
shall
die
i
did
not
want
to
die
so
early
but
it
seems
its
my
fate
the
nurse
and
the
cook
were
in
tears
of
course
sometimes
the
priests
wife
or
some
lady
from
a
neighbouring
estate
would
come
and
see
her
and
she
would
take
them
aside
and
open
her
soul
to
them
always
harping
on
the
same
subject
her
approaching
death
she
spoke
gravely
with
an
unpleasant
smile
even
with
an
angry
face
which
would
not
allow
any
contradiction
she
had
been
smart
and
fashionable
in
her
dress
but
now
in
view
of
her
approaching
death
she
became
slovenly
she
did
not
read
she
did
not
laugh
she
did
not
dream
aloud
what
was
more
she
drove
with
her
aunt
to
the
cemetery
and
selected
a
spot
for
her
tomb
five
days
before
her
confinement
she
made
her
will
and
all
this
bear
in
mind
was
done
in
the
best
of
health
without
the
faintest
hint
of
illness
or
danger
a
confinement
is
a
difficult
affair
and
sometimes
fatal
but
in
the
case
of
which
i
am
telling
you
every
indication
was
favourable
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
her
husband
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
at
last
he
lost
his
temper
one
day
at
dinner
and
asked
her
listen
natasha
when
is
there
going
to
be
an
end
of
this
silliness
its
not
silliness
i
am
in
earnest
nonsense
i
advise
you
to
give
over
being
silly
that
you
may
not
feel
ashamed
of
it
afterwards
well
the
confinement
came
the
husband
got
the
very
best
midwife
from
the
town
it
was
his
wifes
first
confinement
but
it
could
not
have
gone
better
when
it
was
all
over
she
asked
to
look
at
her
baby
she
looked
at
it
and
said
well
now
i
can
die
she
said
goodbye
shut
her
eyes
and
half
an
hour
later
gave
up
her
soul
to
god
she
was
fully
conscious
up
to
the
last
moment
anyway
when
they
gave
her
milk
instead
of
water
she
whispered
softly
why
are
you
giving
me
milk
instead
of
water
so
that
is
what
happened
she
died
as
she
predicted
the
examining
magistrate
paused
gave
a
sigh
and
said
come
explain
why
she
died
i
assure
you
on
my
honour
this
is
not
invented
its
a
fact
the
doctor
looked
at
the
sky
meditatively
you
ought
to
have
had
an
inquest
on
her
he
said
why
why
to
find
out
the
cause
of
her
death
she
didnt
die
because
she
had
predicted
it
she
poisoned
herself
most
probably
the
examining
magistrate
turned
quickly
facing
the
doctor
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
asked
and
from
what
do
you
conclude
that
she
poisoned
herself
i
dont
conclude
it
but
i
assume
it
was
she
on
good
terms
with
her
husband
hm
not
altogether
there
had
been
misunderstandings
soon
after
their
marriage
there
were
unfortunate
circumstances
she
had
found
her
husband
on
one
occasion
with
a
lady
she
soon
forgave
him
however
and
which
came
first
her
husbands
infidelity
or
her
idea
of
dying
the
examining
magistrate
looked
attentively
at
the
doctor
as
though
he
were
trying
to
imagine
why
he
put
that
question
excuse
me
he
said
not
quite
immediately
let
me
try
and
remember
the
examining
magistrate
took
off
his
hat
and
rubbed
his
forehead
yes
yes
it
was
very
shortly
after
that
incident
that
she
began
talking
of
death
yes
yes
well
there
do
you
see
in
all
probability
it
was
at
that
time
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
poison
herself
but
as
most
likely
she
did
not
want
to
kill
her
child
also
she
put
it
off
till
after
her
confinement
not
likely
not
likely
its
impossible
she
forgave
him
at
the
time
that
she
forgave
it
quickly
means
that
she
had
something
bad
in
her
mind
young
wives
do
not
forgive
quickly
the
examining
magistrate
gave
a
forced
smile
and
to
conceal
his
too
noticeable
agitation
began
lighting
a
cigarette
not
likely
not
likely
he
went
on
no
notion
of
anything
of
the
sort
being
possible
ever
entered
into
my
head
and
besides
he
was
not
so
much
to
blame
as
it
seems
he
was
unfaithful
to
her
in
rather
a
queer
way
with
no
desire
to
be
he
came
home
at
night
somewhat
elevated
wanted
to
make
love
to
somebody
his
wife
was
in
an
interesting
condition
then
he
came
across
a
lady
who
had
come
to
stay
for
three
daysdamnation
take
her
an
emptyheaded
creature
silly
and
not
goodlooking
it
couldnt
be
reckoned
as
an
infidelity
his
wife
looked
at
it
in
that
way
herself
and
soon
forgave
it
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
people
dont
die
without
a
reason
said
the
doctor
that
is
so
of
course
but
all
the
same
i
cannot
admit
that
she
poisoned
herself
but
it
is
strange
that
the
idea
has
never
struck
me
before
and
no
one
thought
of
it
everyone
was
astonished
that
her
prediction
had
come
to
pass
and
the
idea
of
such
a
death
was
far
from
their
mind
and
indeed
it
cannot
be
that
she
poisoned
herself
no
the
examining
magistrate
pondered
the
thought
of
the
woman
who
had
died
so
strangely
haunted
him
all
through
the
inquest
as
he
noted
down
what
the
doctor
dictated
to
him
he
moved
his
eyebrows
gloomily
and
rubbed
his
forehead
and
are
there
really
poisons
that
kill
one
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
gradually
without
any
pain
he
asked
the
doctor
while
the
latter
was
opening
the
skull
yes
there
are
morphia
for
instance
hm
strange
i
remember
she
used
to
keep
something
of
the
sort
but
it
could
hardly
be
on
the
way
back
the
examining
magistrate
looked
exhausted
he
kept
nervously
biting
his
moustache
and
was
unwilling
to
talk
let
us
go
a
little
way
on
foot
he
said
to
the
doctor
i
am
tired
of
sitting
after
walking
about
a
hundred
paces
the
examining
magistrate
seemed
to
the
doctor
to
be
overcome
with
fatigue
as
though
he
had
been
climbing
up
a
high
mountain
he
stopped
and
looking
at
the
doctor
with
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
drunk
said
my
god
if
your
theory
is
correct
why
its
it
was
cruel
inhuman
she
poisoned
herself
to
punish
some
one
else
why
was
the
sin
so
great
oh
my
god
and
why
did
you
make
me
a
present
of
this
damnable
idea
doctor
the
examining
magistrate
clutched
at
his
head
in
despair
and
went
on
what
i
have
told
you
was
about
my
own
wife
about
myself
oh
my
god
i
was
to
blame
i
wounded
her
but
can
it
have
been
easier
to
die
than
to
forgive
thats
typical
feminine
logiccruel
merciless
logic
oh
even
then
when
she
was
living
she
was
cruel
i
recall
it
all
now
its
all
clear
to
me
now
as
the
examining
magistrate
talked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
clutched
at
his
head
he
got
back
into
the
carriage
then
walked
again
the
new
idea
the
doctor
had
imparted
to
him
seemed
to
have
overwhelmed
him
to
have
poisoned
him
he
was
distracted
shattered
in
body
and
soul
and
when
he
got
back
to
the
town
he
said
goodbye
to
the
doctor
declining
to
stay
to
dinner
though
he
had
promised
the
doctor
the
evening
before
to
dine
with
him
