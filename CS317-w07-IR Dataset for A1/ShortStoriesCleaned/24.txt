she
died
strange
way
one
fine
day
husband
went
said
that

wife
listened
him
said
you

best
but
it
makes
difference
me
now
before
summer
i
shall
cemetery
husband
course
shrugged
shoulders
smiled
i
not
joking
she
said
i
tell
you
earnest
that
i
shall
soon
dead
what
you
mean
by
soon
directly
after
my
confinement
i
shall
bear
my
child
die
husband
attached
significance
these
words
he
did
not
believe
presentiments
any
sort
he
knew
that
ladies
an
interesting
condition
apt
fanciful
give
way
gloomy
ideas
generally
day
later
wife
spoke
him
again
dying
immediately
after
confinement
then
every
day
she
spoke
it
he
laughed
called
silly
woman
fortune
teller
crazy
creature
approaching
death
became
an
ide
fix
with
wife
when
husband
would
not
listen
she
would
go
into
kitchen
talk
death
nurse
cook
i
havent
long
live
now
nurse
she
would
say
soon
my
confinement
over
i
shall
die
i
did
not
want
die
so
early
but
it
seems
its
my
fate
nurse
cook
were
tears
course
sometimes
priests
wife
or
some
lady
from
neighbouring
estate
would
come
see
she
would
take
them
aside
open
soul
them
always
harping
same
subject
approaching
death
she
spoke
gravely
with
an
unpleasant
smile
even
with
an
angry
face
which
would
not
allow
any
contradiction
she
been
smart
fashionable
dress
but
now
view
approaching
death
she
became
slovenly
she
did
not
read
she
did
not
laugh
she
did
not
dream
aloud
what
was
more
she
drove
with
aunt
cemetery
selected
spot
tomb
five
days
before
confinement
she
made
will
this
bear
mind
was
done
best
health
without
faintest
hint
illness
or
danger
confinement
difficult
affair
sometimes
fatal
but
case
which
i
telling
you
every
indication
was
favourable
there
was
absolutely
nothing
afraid
husband
was
sick
whole
business
last
he
lost
temper
one
day
dinner
asked
listen
natasha
when
there
going
an
end
this
silliness
its
not
silliness
i
earnest
nonsense
i
advise
you
give
over
being
silly
that
you
may
not
feel
ashamed
it
afterwards
well
confinement
came
husband
got
very
best
midwife
from
town
it
was
wifes
first
confinement
but
it
could
not
gone
better
when
it
was
over
she
asked
look
baby
she
looked
it
said
well
now
i
die
she
said
good
bye
shut
eyes
half
an
hour
later
gave
soul
god
she
was
fully
conscious
last
moment
anyway
when
they
gave
milk
instead
water
she
whispered
softly
why
you
giving
me
milk
instead
water
so
that
what
happened
she
died
she
predicted
examining
magistrate
paused
gave
sigh
said
come
explain
why
she
died
i
assure
you
my
honour
this
not
invented
its
fact
doctor
looked
sky
meditatively
you
ought
an
inquest
he
said
why
why
find
out
cause
death
she
didnt
die
because
she
predicted
it
she
poisoned
herself
most
probably
examining
magistrate
turned
quickly
facing
doctor
screwing
eyes
asked
from
what
you
conclude
that
she
poisoned
herself
i
dont
conclude
it
but
i
assume
it
was
she
good
terms
with
husband
hm
not
altogether
there
been
misunderstandings
soon
after
their
marriage
there
were
unfortunate
circumstances
she
found
husband
one
occasion
with
lady
she
soon
forgave
him
however
which
came
first
husbands
infidelity
or
idea
dying
examining
magistrate
looked
attentively
doctor
though
he
were
trying
imagine
why
he
put
that
question
excuse
me
he
said
not
quite
immediately
let
me
try
remember
examining
magistrate
took
off
hat
rubbed
forehead
yes
yes
it
was
very
shortly
after
that
incident
that
she
began
talking
death
yes
yes
well
there
you
see
probability
it
was
that
time
that
she
made
mind
poison
herself
but
most
likely
she
did
not
want
kill
child
also
she
put
it
off
till
after
confinement
not
likely
not
likely
its
impossible
she
forgave
him
time
that
she
forgave
it
quickly
means
that
she
something
bad
mind
young
wives
not
forgive
quickly
examining
magistrate
gave
forced
smile
conceal
too
noticeable
agitation
began
lighting
cigarette
not
likely
not
likely
he
went
notion
anything
sort
being
possible
ever
entered
into
my
head
besides
he
was
not
so
much
blame
it
seems
he
was
unfaithful
rather
queer
way
with
desire
he
came
home
night
somewhat
elevated
wanted
make
love
somebody
wife
was
an
interesting
condition
then
he
came
across
lady
who
come
stay
three
daysdamnation
take
an
empty
headed
creature
silly
not
good
looking
it
couldnt
reckoned
an
infidelity
wife
looked
it
that
way
herself
soon
forgave
it
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
people
dont
die
without
reason
said
doctor
that
so
course
but
same
i
cannot
admit
that
she
poisoned
herself
but
it
strange
that
idea
never
struck
me
before
one
thought
it
everyone
was
astonished
that
prediction
come
pass
idea
such
death
was
far
from
their
mind
indeed
it
cannot
that
she
poisoned
herself
examining
magistrate
pondered
thought
woman
who
died
so
strangely
haunted
him
through
inquest
he
noted
down
what
doctor
dictated
him
he
moved
eyebrows
gloomily
rubbed
forehead
there
really
poisons
that
kill
one
quarter
an
hour
gradually
without
any
pain
he
asked
doctor
while
latter
was
opening
skull
yes
there
morphia
instance
hm
strange
i
remember
she
used
keep
something
sort
but
it
could
hardly
way
back
examining
magistrate
looked
exhausted
he
kept
nervously
biting
moustache
was
unwilling
talk
let
us
go
little
way
foot
he
said
doctor
i
tired
sitting
after
walking
about
hundred
paces
examining
magistrate
seemed
doctor
overcome
with
fatigue
though
he
been
climbing
high
mountain
he
stopped
looking
doctor
with
strange
look
eyes
though
he
were
drunk
said
my
god
if
your
theory
correct
why
its
it
was
cruel
inhuman
she
poisoned
herself
punish
some
one
else
why
was
sin
so
great
oh
my
god
why
did
you
make
me
present
this
damnable
idea
doctor
examining
magistrate
clutched
head
despair
went
what
i
told
you
was
about
my
own
wife
about
myself
oh
my
god
i
was
blame
i
wounded
but
it
been
easier
die
than
forgive
thats
typical
feminine
logiccruel
merciless
logic
oh
even
then
when
she
was
living
she
was
cruel
i
recall
it
now
its
clear
me
now
examining
magistrate
talked
he
shrugged
shoulders
then
clutched
head
he
got
back
into
carriage
then
walked
again
new
idea
doctor
imparted
him
seemed
overwhelmed
him
poisoned
him
he
was
distracted
shattered
body
soul
when
he
got
back
town
he
said
good
bye
doctor
declining
stay
dinner
though
he
promised
doctor
evening
before
dine
with
him
