grigory
petrovitch
zapoikin
man

considerable
popularity
zapoikin
many
my
readers

possesses
rare
talent
impromptu
speechifying
weddings
jubilees
funerals
he
speak
whenever
he
likes
sleep
an
empty
stomach
dead
drunk
or
high
fever
words
flow
smoothly
evenly
like
water
out
pipe
abundance
there
far
more
moving
words
oratorical
dictionary
than
there
beetles
any
restaurant
he
always
speaks
eloquently
great
length
so
much
so
that
some
occasions
particularly
merchants
weddings
they
resort
assistance
from
police
stop
him

only
hope

slowly
so
that
before

not
follow
husband
into

probably
recollecting
pension
waiting
till
everything
was
quiet
again
zapoikin
stepped
forward
turned
eyes
present
began
i
believe
my
eyes
ears
it
not
terrible
dream
this
grave
these
tear
stained
faces
these
moans
lamentations
alas
it
not
dream
our
eyes
not
deceive
us
he
whom
only
so
lately
seen
so
full
courage
so
youthfully
fresh
pure
who
so
lately
before
our
eyes
like
an
unwearying
bee
bore
honey
common
hive
welfare
state
he
who
he
turned
now
dust
inanimate
mirage
inexorable
death
laid
bony
hand
upon
him
time
when
spite
bowed
age
he
was
still
full
bloom
strength
radiant
hopes
an
irremediable
loss
who
will
fill
place
us
good
government
servants
many
but
prokofy
osipitch
was
unique
depths
soul
he
was
devoted
honest
duty
he
did
not
spare
strength
but
worked
late
night
was
disinterested
impervious
bribes
how
he
despised
those
who
detriment
public
interest
sought
corrupt
him
who
by
seductive
goods
this
life
strove
draw
him
betray
duty
yes
before
our
eyes
prokofy
osipitch
would
divide
small
salary
between
poorer
colleagues
you
just
heard
yourselves
lamentations
widows
orphans
who
lived
upon
alms
devoted
good
works
official
duty
he
gave
joys
this
life
even
renounced
happiness
domestic
existence
you
aware
end
days
he
was
bachelor
who
will
replace
him
comrade
i
see
now
kindly
shaven
face
turned
us
with
gentle
smile
i
hear
now
soft
friendly
voice
peace
thine
ashes
prokofy
osipitch
rest
honest
noble
toiler
zapoikin
continued
while
listeners
began
whispering
together
speech
pleased
everyone
drew
some
tears
but
good
many
things
it
seemed
strange
first
place
they
could
not
make
out
why
orator
called
deceased
prokofy
osipitch
when
name
was
kirill
ivanovitch
second
everyone
knew
that
deceased
spent
whole
life
quarelling
with
lawful
wife
so
consequently
could
not
called
bachelor
third
he
thick
red
beard
never
been
known
shave
so
one
could
understand
why
orator
spoke
shaven
face
listeners
were
perplexed
they
glanced
each
other
shrugged
their
shoulders
prokofy
osipitch
continued
orator
looking
with
an
air
inspiration
into
grave
your
face
was
plain
even
hideous
you
were
morose
austere
but
know
that
under
that
outer
husk
there
beat
an
honest
friendly
heart
soon
listeners
began
observe
something
strange
orator
himself
he
gazed
one
point
shifted
about
uneasily
began
shrug
shoulders
too
he
ceased
speaking
gaping
with
astonishment
turned
poplavsky
i
say
hes
alive
he
said
staring
with
horror
whos
alive
why
prokofy
osipitch
there
he
stands
by
that
tombstone
he
never
died
its
kirill
ivanovitch
whos
dead
but
you
told
me
yourself
your
secretary
was
dead
kirill
ivanovitch
was
our
secretary
youve
muddled
it
you
queer
fish
prokofy
osipitch
was
our
secretary
before
thats
true
but
two
years
ago
he
was
transferred
second
division
head
clerk
how
devil
one
tell
why
you
stopping
go
its
awkward
zapoikin
turned
grave
with
same
eloquence
continued
interrupted
speech
prokofy
osipitch
an
old
clerk
with
clean
shaven
face
was
fact
standing
by
tombstone
he
looked
orator
frowned
angrily
well
you
put
your
foot
into
it
havent
you
laughed
fellow
clerks
they
returned
from
funeral
with
zapoikin
burying
man
alive
its
unpleasant
young
man
grumbled
prokofy
osipitch
your
speech
may
right
dead
man
but
reference
living
one
it
nothing
but
sarcasm
upon
my
soul
what
you
been
saying
disinterested
incorruptible
wont
take
bribes
such
things
only
said
living
sarcasm
one
asked
you
sir
expatiate
my
face
plain
hideous
so
it
but
why
exhibit
my
countenance
that
public
way
its
insulting
