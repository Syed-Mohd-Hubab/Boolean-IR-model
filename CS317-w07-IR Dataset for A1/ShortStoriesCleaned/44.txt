the
orator
one
fine
morning
the
collegiate
assessor
kirill
ivanovitch
babilonov
who
had
died
of
the
two
afflictions
so
widely
spread
in
our
country
a
bad
wife
and
alcoholism
was
being
buried
as
the
funeral
procession
set
off
from
the
church
to
the
cemetery
one
of
the
deceaseds
colleagues
called
poplavsky
got
into
a
cab
and
galloped
off
to
find
a
friend
one
grigory
petrovitch
zapoikin
a
man
who
though
still
young
had
acquired
considerable
popularity
zapoikin
as
many
of
my
readers
are
aware
possesses
a
rare
talent
for
impromptu
speechifying
at
weddings
jubilees
and
funerals
he
can
speak
whenever
he
likes
in
his
sleep
on
an
empty
stomach
dead
drunk
or
in
a
high
fever
his
words
flow
smoothly
and
evenly
like
water
out
of
a
pipe
and
in
abundance
there
are
far
more
moving
words
in
his
oratorical
dictionary
than
there
are
beetles
in
any
restaurant
he
always
speaks
eloquently
and
at
great
length
so
much
so
that
on
some
occasions
particularly
at
merchants
weddings
they
have
to
resort
to
assistance
from
the
police
to
stop
him
i
have
come
for
you
old
man
began
poplavsky
finding
him
at
home
put
on
your
hat
and
coat
this
minute
and
come
along
one
of
our
fellows
is
dead
we
are
just
sending
him
off
to
the
other
world
so
you
must
do
a
bit
of
palavering
by
way
of
farewell
to
him
you
are
our
only
hope
if
it
had
been
one
of
the
smaller
fry
it
would
not
have
been
worth
troubling
you
but
you
see
its
the
secretary
a
pillar
of
the
office
in
a
sense
its
awkward
for
such
a
whopper
to
be
buried
without
a
speech
oh
the
secretary
yawned
zapoikin
you
mean
the
drunken
one
yes
there
will
be
pancakes
a
lunch
youll
get
your
cab
fare
come
along
dear
chap
you
spout
out
some
rigmarole
like
a
regular
cicero
at
the
grave
and
what
gratitude
you
will
earn
zapoikin
readily
agreed
he
ruffled
up
his
hair
cast
a
shade
of
melancholy
over
his
face
and
went
out
into
the
street
with
poplavsky
i
know
your
secretary
he
said
as
he
got
into
the
cab
a
cunning
rogue
and
a
beastthe
kingdom
of
heaven
be
hissuch
as
you
dont
often
come
across
come
grisha
it
is
not
the
thing
to
abuse
the
dead
of
course
not
aut
mortuis
nihil
bene
but
still
he
was
a
rascal
the
friends
overtook
the
funeral
procession
and
joined
it
the
coffin
was
borne
along
slowly
so
that
before
they
reached
the
cemetery
they
were
able
three
times
to
drop
into
a
tavern
and
imbibe
a
little
to
the
health
of
the
departed
in
the
cemetery
came
the
service
by
the
graveside
the
mother
in
law
the
wife
and
the
sister
in
law
in
obedience
to
custom
shed
many
tears
when
the
coffin
was
being
lowered
into
the
grave
the
wife
even
shrieked
let
me
go
with
him
but
did
not
follow
her
husband
into
the
grave
probably
recollecting
her
pension
waiting
till
everything
was
quiet
again
zapoikin
stepped
forward
turned
his
eyes
on
all
present
and
began
can
i
believe
my
eyes
and
ears
is
it
not
a
terrible
dream
this
grave
these
tear
stained
faces
these
moans
and
lamentations
alas
it
is
not
a
dream
and
our
eyes
do
not
deceive
us
he
whom
we
have
only
so
lately
seen
so
full
of
courage
so
youthfully
fresh
and
pure
who
so
lately
before
our
eyes
like
an
unwearying
bee
bore
his
honey
to
the
common
hive
of
the
welfare
of
the
state
he
who
he
is
turned
now
to
dust
to
inanimate
mirage
inexorable
death
has
laid
his
bony
hand
upon
him
at
the
time
when
in
spite
of
his
bowed
age
he
was
still
full
of
the
bloom
of
strength
and
radiant
hopes
an
irremediable
loss
who
will
fill
his
place
for
us
good
government
servants
we
have
many
but
prokofy
osipitch
was
unique
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
was
devoted
to
his
honest
duty
he
did
not
spare
his
strength
but
worked
late
at
night
and
was
disinterested
impervious
to
bribes
how
he
despised
those
who
to
the
detriment
of
the
public
interest
sought
to
corrupt
him
who
by
the
seductive
goods
of
this
life
strove
to
draw
him
to
betray
his
duty
yes
before
our
eyes
prokofy
osipitch
would
divide
his
small
salary
between
his
poorer
colleagues
and
you
have
just
heard
yourselves
the
lamentations
of
the
widows
and
orphans
who
lived
upon
his
alms
devoted
to
good
works
and
his
official
duty
he
gave
up
the
joys
of
this
life
and
even
renounced
the
happiness
of
domestic
existence
as
you
are
aware
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
was
a
bachelor
and
who
will
replace
him
as
a
comrade
i
can
see
now
the
kindly
shaven
face
turned
to
us
with
a
gentle
smile
i
can
hear
now
his
soft
friendly
voice
peace
to
thine
ashes
prokofy
osipitch
rest
honest
noble
toiler
zapoikin
continued
while
his
listeners
began
whispering
together
his
speech
pleased
everyone
and
drew
some
tears
but
a
good
many
things
in
it
seemed
strange
in
the
first
place
they
could
not
make
out
why
the
orator
called
the
deceased
prokofy
osipitch
when
his
name
was
kirill
ivanovitch
in
the
second
everyone
knew
that
the
deceased
had
spent
his
whole
life
quarelling
with
his
lawful
wife
and
so
consequently
could
not
be
called
a
bachelor
in
the
third
he
had
a
thick
red
beard
and
had
never
been
known
to
shave
and
so
no
one
could
understand
why
the
orator
spoke
of
his
shaven
face
the
listeners
were
perplexed
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
prokofy
osipitch
continued
the
orator
looking
with
an
air
of
inspiration
into
the
grave
your
face
was
plain
even
hideous
you
were
morose
and
austere
but
we
all
know
that
under
that
outer
husk
there
beat
an
honest
friendly
heart
soon
the
listeners
began
to
observe
something
strange
in
the
orator
himself
he
gazed
at
one
point
shifted
about
uneasily
and
began
to
shrug
his
shoulders
too
all
at
once
he
ceased
speaking
and
gaping
with
astonishment
turned
to
poplavsky
i
say
hes
alive
he
said
staring
with
horror
whos
alive
why
prokofy
osipitch
there
he
stands
by
that
tombstone
he
never
died
its
kirill
ivanovitch
whos
dead
but
you
told
me
yourself
your
secretary
was
dead
kirill
ivanovitch
was
our
secretary
youve
muddled
it
you
queer
fish
prokofy
osipitch
was
our
secretary
before
thats
true
but
two
years
ago
he
was
transferred
to
the
second
division
as
head
clerk
how
the
devil
is
one
to
tell
why
are
you
stopping
go
on
its
awkward
zapoikin
turned
to
the
grave
and
with
the
same
eloquence
continued
his
interrupted
speech
prokofy
osipitch
an
old
clerk
with
a
clean
shaven
face
was
in
fact
standing
by
a
tombstone
he
looked
at
the
orator
and
frowned
angrily
well
you
have
put
your
foot
into
it
havent
you
laughed
his
fellow
clerks
as
they
returned
from
the
funeral
with
zapoikin
burying
a
man
alive
its
unpleasant
young
man
grumbled
prokofy
osipitch
your
speech
may
be
all
right
for
a
dead
man
but
in
reference
to
a
living
one
it
is
nothing
but
sarcasm
upon
my
soul
what
have
you
been
saying
disinterested
incorruptible
wont
take
bribes
such
things
can
only
be
said
of
the
living
in
sarcasm
and
no
one
asked
you
sir
to
expatiate
on
my
face
plain
hideous
so
be
it
but
why
exhibit
my
countenance
in
that
public
way
its
insulting
