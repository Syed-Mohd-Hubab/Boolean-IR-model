overdoing
it
glyeb
gavrilovitch
smirnov
a
land
surveyor
arrived
at
the
station
of
gnilushki
he
had
another
twenty
or
thirty
miles
to
drive
before
he
would
reach
the
estate
which
he
had
been
summoned
to
survey
if
the
driver
were
not
drunk
and
the
horses
were
not
bad
it
would
hardly
be
twenty
miles
but
if
the
driver
had
had
a
drop
and
his
steeds
were
worn
out
it
would
mount
up
to
a
good
forty
tell
me
please
where
can
i
get
post
horses
here
the
surveyor
asked
of
the
station
gendarme
what
post
horses
theres
no
finding
a
decent
dog
for
seventy
miles
round
let
alone
post
horses
but
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
dyevkino
general
hohotovs
estate
well
yawned
the
gendarme
go
outside
the
station
there
are
sometimes
peasants
in
the
yard
there
they
will
take
passengers
the
surveyor
heaved
a
sigh
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
station
there
after
prolonged
enquiries
conversations
and
hesitations
he
found
a
very
sturdy
sullen
looking
pock
marked
peasant
wearing
a
tattered
grey
smock
and
bark
shoes
you
have
got
a
queer
sort
of
cart
said
the
surveyor
frowning
as
he
clambered
into
the
cart
there
is
no
making
out
which
is
the
back
and
which
is
the
front
what
is
there
to
make
out
where
the
horses
tail
is
theres
the
front
and
where
your
honours
sitting
theres
the
back
the
little
mare
was
young
but
thin
with
legs
planted
wide
apart
and
frayed
ears
when
the
driver
stood
up
and
lashed
her
with
a
whip
made
of
cord
she
merely
shook
her
head
when
he
swore
at
her
and
lashed
her
once
more
the
cart
squeaked
and
shivered
as
though
in
a
fever
after
the
third
lash
the
cart
gave
a
lurch
after
the
fourth
it
moved
forward
are
we
going
to
drive
like
this
all
the
way
asked
the
surveyor
violently
jolted
and
marvelling
at
the
capacity
of
russian
drivers
for
combining
a
slow
tortoise
like
pace
with
a
jolting
that
turns
the
soul
inside
out
we
shall
ge
et
there
the
peasant
reassured
him
the
mare
is
young
and
frisky
only
let
her
get
running
and
then
there
is
no
stopping
her
no
ow
cur
sed
brute
it
was
dusk
by
the
time
the
cart
drove
out
of
the
station
on
the
surveyors
right
hand
stretched
a
dark
frozen
plain
endless
and
boundless
if
you
drove
over
it
you
would
certainly
get
to
the
other
side
of
beyond
on
the
horizon
where
it
vanished
and
melted
into
the
sky
there
was
the
languid
glow
of
a
cold
autumn
sunset
on
the
left
of
the
road
mounds
of
some
sort
that
might
be
last
years
stacks
or
might
be
a
village
rose
up
in
the
gathering
darkness
the
surveyor
could
not
see
what
was
in
front
as
his
whole
field
of
vision
on
that
side
was
covered
by
the
broad
clumsy
back
of
the
driver
the
air
was
still
but
it
was
cold
and
frosty
what
a
wilderness
it
is
here
thought
the
surveyor
trying
to
cover
his
ears
with
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
neither
post
nor
paddock
if
by
ill
luck
one
were
attacked
and
robbed
no
one
would
hear
you
whatever
uproar
you
made
and
the
driver
is
not
one
you
could
depend
on
ugh
what
a
huge
back
a
child
of
nature
like
that
has
only
to
move
a
finger
and
it
would
be
all
up
with
one
and
his
ugly
face
is
suspicious
and
brutal
looking
hey
my
good
man
said
the
surveyor
what
is
your
name
mine
klim
well
klim
what
is
it
like
in
your
parts
here
not
dangerous
any
robbers
on
the
road
it
is
all
right
the
lord
has
spared
us
who
should
go
robbing
on
the
road
its
a
good
thing
there
are
no
robbers
but
to
be
ready
for
anything
i
have
got
three
revolvers
with
me
said
the
surveyor
untruthfully
and
it
doesnt
do
to
trifle
with
a
revolver
you
know
one
can
manage
a
dozen
robbers
it
had
become
quite
dark
the
cart
suddenly
began
creaking
squeaking
shaking
and
as
though
unwillingly
turned
sharply
to
the
left
where
is
he
taking
me
to
the
surveyor
wondered
he
has
been
driving
straight
and
now
all
at
once
to
the
left
i
shouldnt
wonder
if
hell
take
me
the
rascal
to
some
den
of
thieves
and
things
like
that
do
happen
i
say
he
said
addressing
the
driver
so
you
tell
me
its
not
dangerous
here
thats
a
pity
i
like
a
fight
with
robbers
i
am
thin
and
sickly
looking
but
i
have
the
strength
of
a
bull
once
three
robbers
attacked
me
and
what
do
you
think
i
gave
one
such
a
dressing
that
that
he
gave
up
his
soul
to
god
you
understand
and
the
other
two
were
sent
to
penal
servitude
in
siberia
and
where
i
got
the
strength
i
cant
say
one
grips
a
strapping
fellow
of
your
sort
with
one
hand
and
wipes
him
out
klim
looked
round
at
the
surveyor
wrinkled
up
his
whole
face
and
lashed
his
horse
yes
the
surveyor
went
on
god
forbid
anyone
should
tackle
me
the
robber
would
have
his
bones
broken
and
whats
more
he
would
have
to
answer
for
it
in
the
police
court
too
i
know
all
the
judges
and
the
police
captains
i
am
a
man
in
the
government
a
man
of
importance
here
i
am
travelling
and
the
authorities
know
they
keep
a
regular
watch
over
me
to
see
no
one
does
me
a
mischief
there
are
policemen
and
village
constables
stuck
behind
bushes
all
along
the
road
sto
sto
stop
the
surveyor
bawled
suddenly
where
have
you
got
to
where
are
you
taking
me
to
why
dont
you
see
its
a
forest
it
certainly
is
a
forest
thought
the
surveyor
i
was
frightened
but
it
wont
do
to
betray
my
feelings
he
has
noticed
already
that
i
am
in
a
funk
why
is
it
he
has
taken
to
looking
round
at
me
so
often
he
is
plotting
something
for
certain
at
first
he
drove
like
a
snail
and
now
how
he
is
dashing
along
i
say
klim
why
are
you
making
the
horse
go
like
that
i
am
not
making
her
go
she
is
racing
along
of
herself
once
she
gets
into
a
run
there
is
no
means
of
stopping
her
its
no
pleasure
to
her
that
her
legs
are
like
that
you
are
lying
my
man
i
see
that
you
are
lying
only
i
advise
you
not
to
drive
so
fast
hold
your
horse
in
a
bit
do
you
hear
hold
her
in
what
for
why
why
because
four
comrades
were
to
drive
after
me
from
the
station
we
must
let
them
catch
us
up
they
promised
to
overtake
us
in
this
forest
it
will
be
more
cheerful
in
their
company
they
are
a
strong
sturdy
set
of
fellows
and
each
of
them
has
got
a
pistol
why
do
you
keep
looking
round
and
fidgeting
as
though
you
were
sitting
on
thorns
eh
i
my
good
fellow
er
my
good
fellow
there
is
no
need
to
look
around
at
me
there
is
nothing
interesting
about
me
except
perhaps
the
revolvers
well
if
you
like
i
will
take
them
out
and
show
you
the
surveyor
made
a
pretence
of
feeling
in
his
pockets
and
at
that
moment
something
happened
which
he
could
not
have
expected
with
all
his
cowardice
klim
suddenly
rolled
off
the
cart
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
go
into
the
forest
help
he
roared
help
take
the
horse
and
the
cart
you
devil
only
dont
take
my
life
help
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
hurriedly
retreating
of
twigs
snappingand
all
was
still
the
surveyor
had
not
expected
such
a
dnouement
he
first
stopped
the
horse
and
then
settled
himself
more
comfortably
in
the
cart
and
fell
to
thinking
he
has
run
off
he
was
scared
the
fool
well
whats
to
be
done
now
i
cant
go
on
alone
because
i
dont
know
the
way
besides
they
may
think
i
have
stolen
his
horse
whats
to
be
done
klim
klim
he
cried
klim
answered
the
echo
at
the
thought
that
he
would
have
to
sit
through
the
whole
night
in
the
cold
and
dark
forest
and
hear
nothing
but
the
wolves
the
echo
and
the
snorting
of
the
scraggy
mare
the
surveyor
began
to
have
twinges
down
his
spine
as
though
it
were
being
rasped
with
a
cold
file
klimushka
he
shouted
dear
fellow
where
are
you
klimushka
for
two
hours
the
surveyor
shouted
and
it
was
only
after
he
was
quite
husky
and
had
resigned
himself
to
spending
the
night
in
the
forest
that
a
faint
breeze
wafted
the
sound
of
a
moan
to
him
klim
is
it
you
dear
fellow
let
us
go
on
youll
mu
ur
der
me
but
i
was
joking
my
dear
man
i
swear
to
god
i
was
joking
as
though
i
had
revolvers
i
told
a
lie
because
i
was
frightened
for
goodness
sake
let
us
go
on
i
am
freezing
klim
probably
reflecting
that
a
real
robber
would
have
vanished
long
ago
with
the
horse
and
cart
came
out
of
the
forest
and
went
hesitatingly
up
to
his
passenger
well
what
were
you
frightened
of
stupid
i
i
was
joking
and
you
were
frightened
get
in
god
be
with
you
sir
klim
muttered
as
he
clambered
into
the
cart
if
i
had
known
i
wouldnt
have
taken
you
for
a
hundred
roubles
i
almost
died
of
fright
klim
lashed
at
the
little
mare
the
cart
swayed
klim
lashed
once
more
and
the
cart
gave
a
lurch
after
the
fourth
stroke
of
the
whip
when
the
cart
moved
forward
the
surveyor
hid
his
ears
in
his
collar
and
sank
into
thought
the
road
and
klim
no
longer
seemed
dangerous
to
him
