out
into
street
astonished
disconcerted
midwife
fastens
door
after
him
goes
back
into
bedroom
hes
good
looking
respectable
but
how
queer
god
bless
man
she
thinks
she
gets
into
bed
but
less
than
half
an
hour
she
hears
another
ring
she
gets
sees
same
kiryakov
again
extraordinary
way
things
mismanaged
neither

marya
petrovna
not
listened
kiryakov
long
but
already
she
feels
that
she
bored
repelled
by
him
that
even
measured
speech
lies
like
weight
soul
she
dresses
goes
out
into
street
with
him
air
still
but
cold
sky
so
overcast
that
light
street
lamps
hardly
visible
sloshy
snow
squelches
under
their
feet
midwife
looks
intently
but
does
not
see
cab
i
suppose
it
not
far
she
asks
not
far
kiryakov
answers
grimly
they
walk
down
one
turning
second
third
kiryakov
strides
along
even
step
respectability
positiveness
apparent
what
awful
weather
midwife
observes
him
but
he
preserves
dignified
silence
it
noticeable
that
he
tries
step
smooth
stones
avoid
spoiling
goloshes
last
after
long
walk
midwife
steps
into
entry
from
which
she
see
big
decently
furnished
drawing
room
there
not
soul
rooms
even
bedroom
where
woman
lying
labour
old
women
relations
who
flock
crowds
every
confinement
not
seen
cook
rushes
about
alone
with
scared
vacant
face
there
sound
loud
groans
three
hours
pass
marya
petrovna
sits
by
mothers
bedside
whispers
two
women
already
time
make
friends
they
got
know
each
other
they
gossip
they
sigh
together
you
mustnt
talk
says
midwife
anxiously
same
time
she
showers
questions
then
door
opens
kiryakov
himself
comes
quietly
stolidly
into
room
he
sits
down
chair
strokes
whiskers
silence
reigns
marya
petrovna
looks
timidly
handsome
passionless
wooden
face
waits
him
begin
talk
but
he
remains
absolutely
silent
absorbed
thought
after
waiting
vain
midwife
makes
mind
begin
herself
utters
phrase
commonly
used
confinements
well
now
thank
god
there
one
human
being
more
world
yes
thats
agreeable
said
kiryakov
preserving
wooden
expression
face
though
indeed
other
hand
more
children
you
must
more
money
baby
not
born
fed
clothed
guilty
expression
comes
into
mothers
face
though
she
brought
creature
into
world
without
permission
or
through
idle
caprice
kiryakov
gets
with
sigh
walks
with
solid
dignity
out
room
what
man
bless
him
says
midwife
mother
hes
so
stern
does
not
smile
mother
tells
that
he
always
like
that
he
honest
fair
prudent
sensibly
economical
but
that
such
an
exceptional
degree
that
simple
mortals
feel
suffocated
by
it
relations
parted
from
him
servants
will
not
stay
more
than
month
they
friends
wife
children
always
tenterhooks
from
terror
over
every
step
they
take
he
does
not
shout
them
nor
beat
them
virtues
far
more
numerous
than
defects
but
when
he
goes
out
house
they
feel
better
more
ease
why
it
so
woman
herself
cannot
say
basins
must
properly
washed
put
away
store
cupboard
says
kiryakov
coming
into
bedroom
these
bottles
must
put
away
too
they
may
come
handy
what
he
says
very
simple
ordinary
but
midwife
some
reason
feels
flustered
she
begins
afraid
man
shudders
every
time
she
hears
footsteps
morning
she
preparing
depart
she
sees
kiryakovs
little
son
pale
close
cropped
schoolboy
dining
room
drinking
tea
kiryakov
standing
opposite
him
saying
flat
even
voice
you
know
how
eat
you
must
know
how
work
too
you
just
swallowed
mouthful
but
not
probably
reflected
that
that
mouthful
costs
money
money
obtained
by
work
you
must
eat
reflect
midwife
looks
boys
dull
face
it
seems
though
very
air
heavy
that
little
more
very
walls
will
fall
unable
endure
crushing
presence
peculiar
man
beside
herself
with
terror
by
now
feeling
violent
hatred
man
marya
petrovna
gathers
bundles
hurriedly
departs
half
way
home
she
remembers
that
she
forgotten
ask
three
roubles
but
after
stopping
thinking
minute
with
wave
hand
she
goes
