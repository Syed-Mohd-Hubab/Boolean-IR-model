a
peculiar
man
between
twelve
and
one
at
night
a
tall
gentleman
wearing
a
top
hat
and
a
coat
with
a
hood
stops
before
the
door
of
marya
petrovna
koshkin
a
midwife
and
an
old
maid
neither
face
nor
hand
can
be
distinguished
in
the
autumn
darkness
but
in
the
very
manner
of
his
coughing
and
the
ringing
of
the
bell
a
certain
solidity
positiveness
and
even
impressiveness
can
be
discerned
after
the
third
ring
the
door
opens
and
marya
petrovna
herself
appears
she
has
a
mans
overcoat
flung
on
over
her
white
petticoat
the
little
lamp
with
the
green
shade
which
she
holds
in
her
hand
throws
a
greenish
light
over
her
sleepy
freckled
face
her
scraggy
neck
and
the
lank
reddish
hair
that
strays
from
under
her
cap
can
i
see
the
midwife
asks
the
gentleman
i
am
the
midwife
what
do
you
want
the
gentleman
walks
into
the
entry
and
marya
petrovna
sees
facing
her
a
tall
well
made
man
no
longer
young
but
with
a
handsome
severe
face
and
bushy
whiskers
i
am
a
collegiate
assessor
my
name
is
kiryakov
he
says
i
came
to
fetch
you
to
my
wife
only
please
make
haste
very
good
the
midwife
assents
ill
dress
at
once
and
i
must
trouble
you
to
wait
for
me
in
the
parlour
kiryakov
takes
off
his
overcoat
and
goes
into
the
parlour
the
greenish
light
of
the
lamp
lies
sparsely
on
the
cheap
furniture
in
patched
white
covers
on
the
pitiful
flowers
and
the
posts
on
which
ivy
is
trained
there
is
a
smell
of
geranium
and
carbolic
the
little
clock
on
the
wall
ticks
timidly
as
though
abashed
at
the
presence
of
a
strange
man
i
am
ready
says
marya
petrovna
coming
into
the
room
five
minutes
later
dressed
washed
and
ready
for
action
let
us
go
yes
you
must
make
haste
says
kiryakov
and
by
the
way
it
is
not
out
of
place
to
enquirewhat
do
you
ask
for
your
services
i
really
dont
know
says
marya
petrovna
with
an
embarrassed
smile
as
much
as
you
will
give
no
i
dont
like
that
says
kiryakov
looking
coldly
and
steadily
at
the
midwife
an
arrangement
beforehand
is
best
i
dont
want
to
take
advantage
of
you
and
you
dont
want
to
take
advantage
of
me
to
avoid
misunderstandings
it
is
more
sensible
for
us
to
make
an
arrangement
beforehand
i
really
dont
knowthere
is
no
fixed
price
i
work
myself
and
am
accustomed
to
respect
the
work
of
others
i
dont
like
injustice
it
will
be
equally
unpleasant
to
me
if
i
pay
you
too
little
or
if
you
demand
from
me
too
much
and
so
i
insist
on
your
naming
your
charge
well
there
are
such
different
charges
hm
in
view
of
your
hesitation
which
i
fail
to
understand
i
am
constrained
to
fix
the
sum
myself
i
can
give
you
two
roubles
good
gracious
upon
my
word
says
marya
petrovna
turning
crimson
and
stepping
back
i
am
really
ashamed
rather
than
take
two
roubles
i
will
come
for
nothing
five
roubles
if
you
like
two
roubles
not
a
kopeck
more
i
dont
want
to
take
advantage
of
you
but
i
do
not
intend
to
be
overcharged
as
you
please
but
i
am
not
coming
for
two
roubles
but
by
law
you
have
not
the
right
to
refuse
very
well
i
will
come
for
nothing
i
wont
have
you
for
nothing
all
work
ought
to
receive
remuneration
i
work
myself
and
i
understand
that
i
wont
come
for
two
roubles
marya
petrovna
answers
mildly
ill
come
for
nothing
if
you
like
in
that
case
i
regret
that
i
have
troubled
you
for
nothing
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
good
bye
well
you
are
a
man
says
marya
petrovna
seeing
him
into
the
entry
i
will
come
for
three
roubles
if
that
will
satisfy
you
kiryakov
frowns
and
ponders
for
two
full
minutes
looking
with
concentration
on
the
floor
then
he
says
resolutely
no
and
goes
out
into
the
street
the
astonished
and
disconcerted
midwife
fastens
the
door
after
him
and
goes
back
into
her
bedroom
hes
good
looking
respectable
but
how
queer
god
bless
the
man
she
thinks
as
she
gets
into
bed
but
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
hears
another
ring
she
gets
up
and
sees
the
same
kiryakov
again
extraordinary
the
way
things
are
mismanaged
neither
the
chemist
nor
the
police
nor
the
house
porters
can
give
me
the
address
of
a
midwife
and
so
i
am
under
the
necessity
of
assenting
to
your
terms
i
will
give
you
three
roubles
but
i
warn
you
beforehand
that
when
i
engage
servants
or
receive
any
kind
of
services
i
make
an
arrangement
beforehand
in
order
that
when
i
pay
there
may
be
no
talk
of
extras
tips
or
anything
of
the
sort
everyone
ought
to
receive
what
is
his
due
marya
petrovna
has
not
listened
to
kiryakov
for
long
but
already
she
feels
that
she
is
bored
and
repelled
by
him
that
his
even
measured
speech
lies
like
a
weight
on
her
soul
she
dresses
and
goes
out
into
the
street
with
him
the
air
is
still
but
cold
and
the
sky
is
so
overcast
that
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
is
hardly
visible
the
sloshy
snow
squelches
under
their
feet
the
midwife
looks
intently
but
does
not
see
a
cab
i
suppose
it
is
not
far
she
asks
no
not
far
kiryakov
answers
grimly
they
walk
down
one
turning
a
second
a
third
kiryakov
strides
along
and
even
in
his
step
his
respectability
and
positiveness
is
apparent
what
awful
weather
the
midwife
observes
to
him
but
he
preserves
a
dignified
silence
and
it
is
noticeable
that
he
tries
to
step
on
the
smooth
stones
to
avoid
spoiling
his
goloshes
at
last
after
a
long
walk
the
midwife
steps
into
the
entry
from
which
she
can
see
a
big
decently
furnished
drawing
room
there
is
not
a
soul
in
the
rooms
even
in
the
bedroom
where
the
woman
is
lying
in
labour
the
old
women
and
relations
who
flock
in
crowds
to
every
confinement
are
not
to
be
seen
the
cook
rushes
about
alone
with
a
scared
and
vacant
face
there
is
a
sound
of
loud
groans
three
hours
pass
marya
petrovna
sits
by
the
mothers
bedside
and
whispers
to
her
the
two
women
have
already
had
time
to
make
friends
they
have
got
to
know
each
other
they
gossip
they
sigh
together
you
mustnt
talk
says
the
midwife
anxiously
and
at
the
same
time
she
showers
questions
on
her
then
the
door
opens
and
kiryakov
himself
comes
quietly
and
stolidly
into
the
room
he
sits
down
in
the
chair
and
strokes
his
whiskers
silence
reigns
marya
petrovna
looks
timidly
at
his
handsome
passionless
wooden
face
and
waits
for
him
to
begin
to
talk
but
he
remains
absolutely
silent
and
absorbed
in
thought
after
waiting
in
vain
the
midwife
makes
up
her
mind
to
begin
herself
and
utters
a
phrase
commonly
used
at
confinements
well
now
thank
god
there
is
one
human
being
more
in
the
world
yes
thats
agreeable
said
kiryakov
preserving
the
wooden
expression
of
his
face
though
indeed
on
the
other
hand
to
have
more
children
you
must
have
more
money
the
baby
is
not
born
fed
and
clothed
a
guilty
expression
comes
into
the
mothers
face
as
though
she
had
brought
a
creature
into
the
world
without
permission
or
through
idle
caprice
kiryakov
gets
up
with
a
sigh
and
walks
with
solid
dignity
out
of
the
room
what
a
man
bless
him
says
the
midwife
to
the
mother
hes
so
stern
and
does
not
smile
the
mother
tells
her
that
he
is
always
like
that
he
is
honest
fair
prudent
sensibly
economical
but
all
that
to
such
an
exceptional
degree
that
simple
mortals
feel
suffocated
by
it
his
relations
have
parted
from
him
the
servants
will
not
stay
more
than
a
month
they
have
no
friends
his
wife
and
children
are
always
on
tenterhooks
from
terror
over
every
step
they
take
he
does
not
shout
at
them
nor
beat
them
his
virtues
are
far
more
numerous
than
his
defects
but
when
he
goes
out
of
the
house
they
all
feel
better
and
more
at
ease
why
it
is
so
the
woman
herself
cannot
say
the
basins
must
be
properly
washed
and
put
away
in
the
store
cupboard
says
kiryakov
coming
into
the
bedroom
these
bottles
must
be
put
away
too
they
may
come
in
handy
what
he
says
is
very
simple
and
ordinary
but
the
midwife
for
some
reason
feels
flustered
she
begins
to
be
afraid
of
the
man
and
shudders
every
time
she
hears
his
footsteps
in
the
morning
as
she
is
preparing
to
depart
she
sees
kiryakovs
little
son
a
pale
close
cropped
schoolboy
in
the
dining
room
drinking
his
tea
kiryakov
is
standing
opposite
him
saying
in
his
flat
even
voice
you
know
how
to
eat
you
must
know
how
to
work
too
you
have
just
swallowed
a
mouthful
but
have
not
probably
reflected
that
that
mouthful
costs
money
and
money
is
obtained
by
work
you
must
eat
and
reflect
the
midwife
looks
at
the
boys
dull
face
and
it
seems
to
her
as
though
the
very
air
is
heavy
that
a
little
more
and
the
very
walls
will
fall
unable
to
endure
the
crushing
presence
of
the
peculiar
man
beside
herself
with
terror
and
by
now
feeling
a
violent
hatred
for
the
man
marya
petrovna
gathers
up
her
bundles
and
hurriedly
departs
half
way
home
she
remembers
that
she
has
forgotten
to
ask
for
her
three
roubles
but
after
stopping
and
thinking
for
a
minute
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
she
goes
on
