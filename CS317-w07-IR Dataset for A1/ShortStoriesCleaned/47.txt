yegoritch
krasnyhin
fourth
rate
journalist
returns
home
late
night
grave
careworn
with
peculiar
air
concentration
he
looks
like
man
expecting
police
raid
or
contemplating
suicide
pacing
about
rooms
he
halts
abruptly
ruffles
hair
says
tone
which
laertes
announces
intention
avenging
sister
shattered
soul
weary
sick
load
misery
heart
then
sit
down
write
this
called
life
how
it
nobody
described
agonizing
discord
soul
writer
who
amuse
crowd
when
heart
heavy
or
shed
tears
word
command
when
heart
light
i
must
playful
coldly
unconcerned
witty
but
what
if
i
weighed
down
with
misery
what
if
i
ill
or
my
child
dying
or
my
wife
anguish
he
says
this
brandishing
fists
rolling
eyes
then
he
goes
into
bedroom
wakes
wife
nadya

says

me
energy
my
work
returning
room
he
takes
off
coat
waistcoat
boots
he
does
this
very
slowly
then
assuming
an
expression
injured
innocence
he
sits
down
table
there
nothing
casual
nothing
ordinary
writing
table
down
veriest
trifle
everything
bears
stamp
stern
deliberately
planned
programme
little
busts
photographs
distinguished
writers
heaps
rough
manuscripts
volume
byelinsky
with
page
turned
down
part
skull
by
way
an
ash
tray
sheet
newspaper
folded
carelessly
but
so
that
passage
uppermost
boldly
marked
blue
pencil
with
word
disgraceful
there
dozen
sharply
pointed
pencils
several
penholders
fitted
with
new
nibs
put
readiness
that
accidental
breaking
pen
may
single
second
interrupt
flight
creative
fancy
ivan
yegoritch

still
splitting
shavings
rattling
with
doors
blowers
stove
ivan
yegoritch
starts
opens
frightened
eyes
begins
sniff
air
heavens
stove
smoking
he
groans
grimacing
with
face
agony
smoking
that
insufferable
woman
makes
point
trying
poison
me
how
gods
name
i
write
such
surroundings
kindly
tell
me
that
he
rushes
into
kitchen
breaks
into
theatrical
wail
when
little
later
wife
stepping
cautiously
tiptoe
brings
him
glass
tea
he
sitting
an
easy
chair
before
with
eyes
closed
absorbed
article
he
does
not
stir
drums
lightly
forehead
with
two
fingers
pretends
he
not
aware
wifes
presence
face
wears
an
expression
injured
innocence
like
girl
who
been
presented
with
costly
fan
he
spends
long
time
coquetting
grimacing
posing
himself
before
he
writes
title
he
presses
temples
he
wriggles
draws
legs
under
chair
though
he
were
pain
or
half
closes
eyes
languidly
like
cat
sofa
last
not
without
hesitation
he
stretches
out
hand
towards
inkstand
with
an
expression
though
he
were
signing
death
warrant
writes
title

give
me
some
water
he
hears
sons
voice
hush
says
mother
daddys
