hush
ivan
yegoritch
krasnyhin
a
fourth
rate
journalist
returns
home
late
at
night
grave
and
careworn
with
a
peculiar
air
of
concentration
he
looks
like
a
man
expecting
a
police
raid
or
contemplating
suicide
pacing
about
his
rooms
he
halts
abruptly
ruffles
up
his
hair
and
says
in
the
tone
in
which
laertes
announces
his
intention
of
avenging
his
sister
shattered
soul
weary
a
sick
load
of
misery
on
the
heart
and
then
to
sit
down
and
write
and
this
is
called
life
how
is
it
nobody
has
described
the
agonizing
discord
in
the
soul
of
a
writer
who
has
to
amuse
the
crowd
when
his
heart
is
heavy
or
to
shed
tears
at
the
word
of
command
when
his
heart
is
light
i
must
be
playful
coldly
unconcerned
witty
but
what
if
i
am
weighed
down
with
misery
what
if
i
am
ill
or
my
child
is
dying
or
my
wife
in
anguish
he
says
this
brandishing
his
fists
and
rolling
his
eyes
then
he
goes
into
the
bedroom
and
wakes
his
wife
nadya
he
says
i
am
sitting
down
to
write
please
dont
let
anyone
interrupt
me
i
cant
write
with
children
crying
or
cooks
snoring
see
too
that
theres
tea
and
steak
or
something
you
know
that
i
cant
write
without
tea
tea
is
the
one
thing
that
gives
me
the
energy
for
my
work
returning
to
his
room
he
takes
off
his
coat
waistcoat
and
boots
he
does
this
very
slowly
then
assuming
an
expression
of
injured
innocence
he
sits
down
to
his
table
there
is
nothing
casual
nothing
ordinary
on
his
writing
table
down
to
the
veriest
trifle
everything
bears
the
stamp
of
a
stern
deliberately
planned
programme
little
busts
and
photographs
of
distinguished
writers
heaps
of
rough
manuscripts
a
volume
of
byelinsky
with
a
page
turned
down
part
of
a
skull
by
way
of
an
ash
tray
a
sheet
of
newspaper
folded
carelessly
but
so
that
a
passage
is
uppermost
boldly
marked
in
blue
pencil
with
the
word
disgraceful
there
are
a
dozen
sharply
pointed
pencils
and
several
penholders
fitted
with
new
nibs
put
in
readiness
that
no
accidental
breaking
of
a
pen
may
for
a
single
second
interrupt
the
flight
of
his
creative
fancy
ivan
yegoritch
throws
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
closing
his
eyes
concentrates
himself
on
his
subject
he
hears
his
wife
shuffling
about
in
her
slippers
and
splitting
shavings
to
heat
the
samovar
she
is
hardly
awake
that
is
apparent
from
the
way
the
knife
and
the
lid
of
the
samovar
keep
dropping
from
her
hands
soon
the
hissing
of
the
samovar
and
the
spluttering
of
the
frying
meat
reaches
him
his
wife
is
still
splitting
shavings
and
rattling
with
the
doors
and
blowers
of
the
stove
all
at
once
ivan
yegoritch
starts
opens
frightened
eyes
and
begins
to
sniff
the
air
heavens
the
stove
is
smoking
he
groans
grimacing
with
a
face
of
agony
smoking
that
insufferable
woman
makes
a
point
of
trying
to
poison
me
how
in
gods
name
am
i
to
write
in
such
surroundings
kindly
tell
me
that
he
rushes
into
the
kitchen
and
breaks
into
a
theatrical
wail
when
a
little
later
his
wife
stepping
cautiously
on
tiptoe
brings
him
in
a
glass
of
tea
he
is
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
as
before
with
his
eyes
closed
absorbed
in
his
article
he
does
not
stir
drums
lightly
on
his
forehead
with
two
fingers
and
pretends
he
is
not
aware
of
his
wifes
presence
his
face
wears
an
expression
of
injured
innocence
like
a
girl
who
has
been
presented
with
a
costly
fan
he
spends
a
long
time
coquetting
grimacing
and
posing
to
himself
before
he
writes
the
title
he
presses
his
temples
he
wriggles
and
draws
his
legs
up
under
his
chair
as
though
he
were
in
pain
or
half
closes
his
eyes
languidly
like
a
cat
on
the
sofa
at
last
not
without
hesitation
he
stretches
out
his
hand
towards
the
inkstand
and
with
an
expression
as
though
he
were
signing
a
death
warrant
writes
the
title
mammy
give
me
some
water
he
hears
his
sons
voice
hush
says
his
mother
daddys
writing
hush
daddy
writes
very
very
quickly
without
corrections
or
pauses
he
has
scarcely
time
to
turn
over
the
pages
the
busts
and
portraits
of
celebrated
authors
look
at
his
swiftly
racing
pen
and
keeping
stock
still
seem
to
be
thinking
oh
my
how
you
are
going
it
sh
squeaks
the
pen
sh
whisper
the
authors
when
his
knee
jolts
the
table
and
they
are
set
trembling
all
at
once
krasnyhin
draws
himself
up
lays
down
his
pen
and
listens
he
hears
an
even
monotonous
whispering
it
is
foma
nikolaevitch
the
lodger
in
the
next
room
saying
his
prayers
i
say
cries
krasnyhin
couldnt
you
please
say
your
prayers
more
quietly
you
prevent
me
from
writing
very
sorry
foma
nikolaevitch
answers
timidly
after
covering
five
pages
krasnyhin
stretches
and
looks
at
his
watch
goodness
three
oclock
already
he
moans
other
people
are
asleep
while
i
i
alone
must
work
shattered
and
exhausted
he
goes
with
his
head
on
one
side
to
the
bedroom
to
wake
his
wife
and
says
in
a
languid
voice
nadya
get
me
some
more
tea
i
feel
weak
he
writes
till
four
oclock
and
would
readily
have
written
till
six
if
his
subject
had
not
been
exhausted
coquetting
and
posing
to
himself
and
the
inanimate
objects
about
him
far
from
any
indiscreet
critical
eye
tyrannizing
and
domineering
over
the
little
anthill
that
fate
has
put
in
his
power
are
the
honey
and
the
salt
of
his
existence
and
how
different
is
this
despot
here
at
home
from
the
humble
meek
dull
witted
little
man
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
the
editors
offices
i
am
so
exhausted
that
i
am
afraid
i
shant
sleep
he
says
as
he
gets
into
bed
our
work
this
cursed
ungrateful
hard
labour
exhausts
the
soul
even
more
than
the
body
i
had
better
take
some
bromide
god
knows
if
it
were
not
for
my
family
id
throw
up
the
work
to
write
to
order
it
is
awful
he
sleeps
till
twelve
or
one
oclock
in
the
day
sleeps
a
sound
healthy
sleep
ah
how
he
would
sleep
what
dreams
he
would
have
how
he
would
spread
himself
if
he
were
to
become
a
well
known
writer
an
editor
or
even
a
sub
editor
he
has
been
writing
all
night
whispers
his
wife
with
a
scared
expression
on
her
face
sh
no
one
dares
to
speak
or
move
or
make
a
sound
his
sleep
is
something
sacred
and
the
culprit
who
offends
against
it
will
pay
dearly
for
his
fault
hush
floats
over
the
flat
hush
