cottonwool
in

ears
came
out
of
his
hotelroom
into
the
passage
and
in
a
cracked
voice
cried
semyon
waiter
and
looking
at
his
frightened
face
one
might
have
supposed
that
the
ceiling
had
fallen
in
on
him
or
that
he
had
just
seen
a
ghost
in
his
room
upon
my
word
semyon
he
cried
seeing
the
attendant
running
towards
him
what

the
meaning
of
it

rheumatic
delicate
man

place
where

was
in
the
habit
of
putting

and
scratched
his
head

if

to

to
a
lady
and

all
through
you
here
if
you
please
through
this
foolishness
i
am
to
wake
up
a
respectable
woman
sighing
and
coughing
murkin
went
to
the
door
of
the
next
room
and
cautiously
tapped
whos
there
he
heard
a
womans
voice
a
minute
later
its
i
murkin
began
in
a
plaintive
voice
standing
in
the
attitude
of
a
cavalier
addressing
a
lady
of
the
highest
society
pardon
my
disturbing
you
madam
but
i
am
a
man
in
delicate
health
rheumatic
the
doctors
madam
have
ordered
me
to
keep
my
feet
warm
especially
as
i
have
to
go
at
once
to
tune
the
piano
at
madame
la
gnrale
shevelitsyns
i
cant
go
to

boots
and
put
them
by
mistake
in
your
room
be
so
extremely
kind
madam
as
to
give
me
my
boots
there
was
a
sound
of
rustling
of
jumping
off
the
bed
and
the
flapping
of
slippers
after
which
the
door
opened
slightly
and
a
plump
feminine
hand
flung
at
murkins
feet
a
pair
of
boots
the
pianotuner
thanked
her
and
went
into
his
own
room
odd
he
muttered
putting
on
the
boots
it
seems
as
though
this
is
not
the
right
boot
why
here

two
left
boots
both
are
for
the
left
foot
i
say
semyon

are
not
my
boots
my
boots
have
red
tags
and
no
patches
on
them
and
these
are
in
holes
and
have
no
tags
semyon
picked
up
the
boots
turned
them
over
several
times
before
his
eyes
and
frowned
those
are
pavel
alexandritchs
boots
he
grumbled
squinting
at
them
he
squinted
with
the
left
eye
what

alexandritch
the
actor

every
tuesday
he
must

wait
till
next
tuesday
he
only
comes
here
on
tuesdays
but
why
are
there
two
boots
for
the
left
foot
asked
the
pianotuner
picking
up
the
boots
with
an
air
of
disgust
what
god
has
sent
him
that
he
wears
through
poverty
where
is
an
actor
to
get
boots
i
said
to
him
what
boots
pavel
alexandritch
they
are
a
positive
disgrace
and
he
said
hold
your
peace
says
he
and
turn
pale
in
those
very
boots
says
he
i
have
played
counts
and
princes
a
queer
lot
artists
thats
the
only
word
for
them
if
i
were
the
governor
or
anyone
in
command
i
would
get
all
these
actors
together
and
clap
them
all
in
prison
continually
sighing
and
groaning
and
knitting
his
brows
murkin
drew
the
two
left
boots
on
to
his
feet
and
set
off
limping
to
madame
la
gnrale
shevelitsyns
he
went
about
the
town
all
day
long
tuning
pianos
and
all
day
long
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
was
looking
at
his
feet
and
seeing
his
patched
boots
with
heels
worn
down
at
the
sides
apart
from
his
moral
agonies
he
had
to
suffer
physically
also
the
boots
gave
him
a
corn
in
the
evening
he
was
at
the
theatre
there
was
a
performance
of
bluebeard
it
was
only
just
before
the
last
act
and
then
only
thanks
to
the
good
offices
of
a
man
he
knew
who
played
a
flute
in
the
orchestra
that
he
gained
admittance
behind
the
scenes
going
to
the
mens
dressingroom
he
found
there
all
the
male
performers
some
were
changing
their
clothes
others
were
painting
their
faces
others
were
smoking
bluebeard
was
standing
with
king
bobesh
showing
him
a
revolver
you
had
better
buy
it
said
bluebeard
i
bought
it
at
kursk
a
bargain
for
eight
roubles
but
there
i
will
let
you
have
it
for
six
a
wonderfully
good
one
steady
its
loaded
you
know
can
i
see
mr
blistanov
the
pianotuner
asked
as
he
went
in
i
am
he
said
bluebeard
turning
to
him
what
do
you
want
excuse
my
troubling
you
sir
began
the
pianotuner
in
an
imploring
voice
but
believe
me
i
am
a
man
in
delicate
health
rheumatic
the
doctors
have
ordered
me
to
keep
my
feet
warm
but
speaking
plainly
what
do
you
want
you
see
said
the
pianotuner
addressing
bluebeard
er

stayed
last
night
at
buhteyevs
furnished
apartments

king
bobesh
with
a
grin

murkin
smiled
it
was
she
your
good
lady
who

after
this
gentleman
the
pianotuner
indicated
blistanovhad
gone
away
i
missed
my
boots
i
called
the
waiter
you
know
and
he
said
i
left
your
boots
in
the
next
room
by
mistake
being
in
a
state
of
intoxication
he
left
my
boots
as
well
as
yours
at
said
murkin
turning
to
blistanov
and
when
you
left
this
gentlemans
lady
you
put
on
mine
what

you
talking
about

blistanov
and
he
scowled

murkin
in
great
confusion
sitting
down
and
taking
off
the
boots
i
did

but
this
gentlemans
lady
threw
out
your
boots
here
to
me
instead

what
right

you
sir
to
make
such
assertions
i
say
nothing
about
myself
but
you
are
slandering
a
woman
and
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
too
a
fearful
hubbub
arose
behind
the
scenes
king
bobesh
the
injured
husband
suddenly
turned
crimson
and
brought
his
fist
down
upon
the
table
with
such
violence
that
two
actresses
in
the
next
dressingroom
felt
faint
and
you
believe
it
cried
bluebeard
you
believe
this
worthless
rascal
ooh
would
you
like
me
to
kill
him
like
a
dog
would
you
like
it
i
will
turn
him
into
a
beefsteak
ill
blow
his
brains
out
and
all
the
persons
who
were
promenading
that
evening
in
the
town
park
by
the
summer
theatre
describe
to
this
day
how
just
before
the
fourth
act
they
saw
a
man
with
bare
feet
a
yellow
face
and
terrorstricken
eyes
dart
out
of
the
theatre
and
dash
along
the
principal
avenue
he
was
pursued
by
a
man
in
the
costume
of
bluebeard
armed
with
a
revolver
what
happened
later
no
one
saw
all
that
is
known
is
that
murkin
was
confined
to
his
bed
for
a
fortnight
after
his
acquaintance
with
blistanov
and
that

the
words
