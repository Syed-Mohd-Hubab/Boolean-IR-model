in
the
graveyard
the
wind
has
got
up
friends
and
it
is
beginning
to
get
dark
hadnt
we
better
take
ourselves
off
before
it
gets
worse
the
wind
was
frolicking
among
the
yellow
leaves
of
the
old
birch
trees
and
a
shower
of
thick
drops
fell
upon
us
from
the
leaves
one
of
our
party
slipped
on
the
clayey
soil
and
clutched
at
a
big
grey
cross
to
save
himself
from
falling
yegor
gryaznorukov
titular
councillor
and
cavalier
he
read
i
knew
that
gentleman
he
was
fond
of
his
wife
he
wore
the
stanislav
ribbon
and
read
nothing
his
digestion
worked
well
life
was
all
right
wasnt
it
one
would
have
thought
he
had
no
reason
to
die
but
alas
fate
had
its
eye
on
him
the
poor
fellow
fell
a
victim
to
his
habits
of
observation
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
listening
at
a
keyhole
he
got
such
a
bang
on
the
head
from
the
door
that
he
sustained
concussion
of
the
brain
he
had
a
brain
and
died
and
here
under
this
tombstone
lies
a
man
who
from
his
cradle
detested
verses
and
epigrams
as
though
to
mock
him
his
whole
tombstone
is
adorned
with
verses
there
is
someone
coming
a
man
in
a
shabby
overcoat
with
a
shaven
bluishcrimson
countenance
overtook
us
he
had
a
bottle
under
his
arm
and
a
parcel
of
sausage
was
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
where
is
the
grave
of
mushkin
the
actor
he
asked
us
in
a
husky
voice
we
conducted
him
towards
the
grave
of
mushkin
the
actor
who
had
died
two
years
before
you
are
a
government
clerk
i
suppose
we
asked
him
no
an
actor
nowadays
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
actors
from
clerks
of
the
consistory
no
doubt
you
have
noticed
that
thats
typical
but
its
not
very
flattering
for
the
government
clerk
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
found
the
actors
grave
it
had
sunken
was
overgrown
with
weeds
and
had
lost
all
appearance
of
a
grave
a
cheap
little
cross
that
had
begun
to
rot
and
was
covered
with
green
moss
blackened
by
the
frost
had
an
air
of
aged
dejection
and
looked
as
it
were
ailing
forgotten
friend
mushkin
we
read
time
had
erased
the
never
and
corrected
the
falsehood
of
man
a
subscription
for
a
monument
to
him
was
got
up
among
actors
and
journalists
but
they
drank
up
the
money
the
dear
fellows
sighed
the
actor
bowing
down
to
the
ground
and
touching
the
wet
earth
with
his
knees
and
his
cap
how
do
you
mean
drank
it
thats
very
simple
they
collected
the
money
published
a
paragraph
about
it
in
the
newspaper
and
spent
it
on
drink
i
dont
say
it
to
blame
them
i
hope
it
did
them
good
dear
things
good
health
to
them
and
eternal
memory
to
him
drinking
means
bad
health
and
eternal
memory
nothing
but
sadness
god
give
us
remembrance
for
a
time
but
eternal
memorywhat
next
you
are
right
there
mushkin
was
a
wellknown
man
you
see
there
were
a
dozen
wreaths
on
the
coffin
and
he
is
already
forgotten
those
to
whom
he
was
dear
have
forgotten
him
but
those
to
whom
he
did
harm
remember
him
i
for
instance
shall
never
never
forget
him
for
i
got
nothing
but
harm
from
him
i
have
no
love
for
the
deceased
what
harm
did
he
do
you
great
harm
sighed
the
actor
and
an
expression
of
bitter
resentment
overspread
his
face
to
me
he
was
a
villain
and
a
scoundrelthe
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
it
was
through
looking
at
him
and
listening
to
him
that
i
became
an
actor
by
his
art
he
lured
me
from
the
parental
home
he
enticed
me
with
the
excitements
of
an
actors
life
promised
me
all
sorts
of
thingsand
brought
tears
and
sorrow
an
actors
lot
is
a
bitter
one
i
have
lost
youth
sobriety
and
the
divine
semblance
i
havent
a
halfpenny
to
bless
myself
with
my
shoes
are
down
at
heel
my
breeches
are
frayed
and
patched
and
my
face
looks
as
if
it
had
been
gnawed
by
dogs
my
heads
full
of
freethinking
and
nonsense
he
robbed
me
of
my
faithmy
evil
genius
it
would
have
been
something
if
i
had
had
talent
but
as
it
is
i
am
ruined
for
nothing
its
cold
honoured
friends
wont
you
have
some
there
is
enough
for
all
brrr
let
us
drink
to
the
rest
of
his
soul
though
i
dont
like
him
and
though
hes
dead
he
was
the
only
one
i
had
in
the
world
the
only
one
its
the
last
time
i
shall
visit
him
the
doctors
say
i
shall
soon
die
of
drink
so
here
i
have
come
to
say
good
bye
one
must
forgive
ones
enemies
we
left
the
actor
to
converse
with
the
dead
mushkin
and
went
on
it
began
drizzling
a
fine
cold
rain
at
the
turning
into
the
principal
avenue
strewn
with
gravel
we
met
a
funeral
procession
four
bearers
wearing
white
calico
sashes
and
muddy
high
boots
with
leaves
sticking
on
them
carried
the
brown
coffin
it
was
getting
dark
and
they
hastened
stumbling
and
shaking
their
burden
weve
only
been
walking
here
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
that
is
the
third
brought
in
already
shall
we
go
home
friends
