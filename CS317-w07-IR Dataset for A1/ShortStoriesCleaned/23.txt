kirilov
turned
back
abogin
stood
still
moment
slowly
walked
into
drawing
room
judging
from
unsteady
mechanical
step
from
attention
with
which
he
set
straight
fluffy
shade
unlighted
lamp
drawing
room
glanced
into
thick
book
lying
table
that
instant
he
intention
desire
was
thinking
nothing
most
likely
did
not
remember
that
there
was
stranger
entry
twilight
stillness
drawing
room
seemed
increase
numbness
going
out
drawing
room
into
study
he
raised
right
foot
higher
than
was
necessary
felt
doorposts
with
hands
he
did
so
there
was
an
air
perplexity
about
whole
figure
though
he
were
somebody
elses
house
or
were
drunk
first
time
life
were
now
abandoning
himself
with
surprise
new
sensation
broad
streak
light
stretched
across
bookcase
one
wall
study
this
light
came
together
with
close
heavy
smell
carbolic
ether
from
door
into
bedroom
which
stood
little
way
open
doctor
sank
into
low
chair
front
table
minute
he
stared
drowsily
books
which
lay
with
light
them
then
got
went
into
bedroom
here
bedroom
reigned
dead
silence
everything
smallest
detail
was
eloquent
storm
that
been
passed
through
exhaustion
everything
was
rest
candle
standing
among
crowd
bottles
boxes
pots
stool
big
lamp
chest
drawers
threw
brilliant
light
over
room
bed
under
window
lay
boy
with
open
eyes
look
wonder
face
he
did
not
move
but
open
eyes
seemed
every
moment
growing
darker
sinking
further
into
head
mother
was
kneeling
by
bed
with
arms
body
head
hidden
bedclothes
like
child
she
did
not
stir
but
what
throbbing
life
was
suggested
curves
body
arms
she
leaned
against
bed
with
being
pressing
against
it
greedily
with
might
though
she
were
afraid
disturbing
peaceful
comfortable
attitude
she
found
last
exhausted
body
bedclothes
rags
bowls
splashes
water
floor
little
paint
brushes
spoons
thrown
down
here
there
white
bottle
lime
water
very
air
heavy
stifling
were
hushed
seemed
plunged
repose
doctor
stopped
close
wife
thrust
hands
trouser
pockets
slanting
head
one
side
fixed
eyes
son
face
bore
an
expression
indifference
only
from
drops
that
glittered
beard
it
could
seen
that
he
just
been
crying
that
repellent
horror
which
thought
when
speak
death
was
absent
from
room
numbness
everything
mothers
attitude
indifference
doctors
face
there
was
something
that
attracted
touched
heart
that
subtle
almost
elusive
beauty
human
sorrow
which
men
will
not
long
time
learn
understand
describe
which
it
seems
only
music
convey
there
was
feeling
beauty
too
austere
stillness
kirilov
wife
were
silent
not
weeping
though
besides
bitterness
their
loss
they
were
conscious
too
tragedy
their
position
just
their
youth
passed
away
so
now
together
with
this
boy
their
right
children
gone
ever
eternity
doctor
was
forty
four
hair
was
grey
he
looked
like
an
old
man
faded
invalid
wife
was
thirty
five
andrey
was
not
merely
only
child
but
also
last
child
contrast
wife
doctor
belonged
class
people
who
times
spiritual
suffering
feel
craving
movement
after
standing
five
minutes
by
wife
he
walked
raising
right
foot
high
from
bedroom
into
little
room
which
was
half
filled
by
big
sofa
from
there
he
went
into
kitchen
after
wandering
by
stove
cooks
bed
he
bent
down
went
by
little
door
into
passage
there
he
saw
again
white
scarf
white
face
last
sighed
abogin
reaching
towards
door
handle
let
us
go
please
doctor
started
glanced
him
remembered
why
i
told
you
already
that
i
cant
go
he
said
growing
more
animated
how
strange
doctor
i
not
stone
i
fully
understand
your
position
i
feel
you
abogin
said
an
imploring
voice
laying
hand
scarf
but
i
not
asking
you
myself
my
wife
dying
if
you
heard
that
cry
if
you
seen
face
you
would
understand
my
pertinacity
my
god
i
thought
you
gone
get
ready
doctor
time
precious
let
us
go
i
entreat
you
i
cannot
go
said
kirilov
emphatically
he
took
step
into
drawing
room
abogin
followed
him
caught
hold
sleeve
you
sorrow
i
understand
but
im
not
asking
you
case
toothache
or
consultation
but
save
human
life
he
went
entreating
like
beggar
life
comes
before
any
personal
sorrow
come
i
ask
courage
heroism
love
humanity
humanity
that
cuts
both
ways
kirilov
said
irritably
name
humanity
i
beg
you
not
take
me
how
queer
it
really
i
hardly
stand
you
talk
me
about
humanity
i
fit
nothing
just
now
nothing
will
induce
me
go
i
cant
leave
my
wife
alone
kirilov
waved
hands
staggered
back
dont
ask
me
he
went
tone
alarm
excuse
me
by
xiii
regulations
i
obliged
go
you
right
drag
me
by
my
collar
drag
me
if
you
like
but
i
not
fit
i
cant
even
speak
excuse
me
there
need
take
that
tone
me
doctor
said
abogin
again
taking
doctor
by
sleeve
what
i
care
about
xiii
force
you
against
your
will
i
right
whatever
if
you
will
come
if
you
will
not
god
forgive
you
but
i
not
appealing
your
will
but
your
feelings
young
woman
dying
you
were
just
speaking
death
your
son
who
should
understand
my
horror
if
not
you
abogins
voice
quivered
with
emotion
that
quiver
tone
were
far
more
persuasive
than
words
abogin
was
sincere
but
it
was
remarkable
that
whatever
he
said
words
sounded
stilted
soulless
inappropriately
flowery
even
seemed
an
outrage
atmosphere
doctors
home
woman
who
was
somewhere
dying
he
felt
this
himself
so
afraid
not
being
understood
did
utmost
put
softness
tenderness
into
voice
so
that
sincerity
tone
might
prevail
if
words
did
not
rule
however
fine
deep
phrase
may
it
only
affects
indifferent
cannot
fully
satisfy
those
who
happy
or
unhappy
that
why
dumbness
most
often
highest
expression
happiness
or
unhappiness
lovers
understand
each
other
better
when
they
silent
fervent
passionate
speech
delivered
by
grave
only
touches
outsiders
while
widow
children
dead
man
it
seems
cold
trivial
kirilov
stood
silence
when
abogin
uttered
few
more
phrases
concerning
noble
calling
doctor
self
sacrifice
so
doctor
asked
sullenly
it
far
something
like
eight
or
nine
miles
i
capital
horses
doctor
i
give
you
my
word
honour
that
i
will
get
you
there
back
an
hour
only
one
hour
these
words
more
effect
kirilov
than
appeals
humanity
or
noble
calling
doctor
he
thought
moment
said
with
sigh
very
well
let
us
go
he
went
rapidly
with
more
certain
step
study
afterwards
came
back
long
frock
coat
abogin
greatly
relieved
fidgeted
round
him
scraped
with
feet
he
helped
him
with
overcoat
went
out
house
with
him
it
was
dark
out
doors
though
lighter
than

tall
stooping
figure
doctor
with
long
narrow
beard
aquiline
nose
stood
out
distinctly
darkness
abogins
big
head
little
students
cap
that
barely
covered

was
hidden
by
long
hair

muttered
he
helped
doctor
into
carriage

get
there
quickly

fast
you
luka
theres
good
fellow
please
coachman
drove
rapidly
first
there
was
row
indistinct
buildings
that
stretched
alongside
hospital
yard
it
was
dark
everywhere
except
bright
light
from
window
that
gleamed
through
fence
into
furthest
part
yard
while
three
windows
upper
storey
hospital
looked
paler
than
surrounding
air
then
carriage
drove
into
dense
shadow
here
there
was
smell
dampness
mushrooms
sound
rustling
trees
crows
awakened
by
noise
wheels
stirred
among
foliage
uttered
prolonged
plaintive
cries
though
they
knew
doctors
son
was
dead
that
abogins
wife
was
ill
then
came
glimpses
separate
trees
bushes
pond
which
great
black
shadows
were
slumbering
gleamed
with
sullen
light
carriage
rolled
over
smooth
level
ground
clamour
crows
sounded
dimly
far
away
soon
ceased
altogether
kirilov
abogin
were
silent
almost
way
only
abogin
heaved
deep
sigh
muttered
its
an
agonizing
state
one
never
loves
those
who
near
one
so
much
when
one
danger
losing
them
when
carriage
slowly
drove
over
river
kirilov
started
though
splash
water
frightened
him
made
movement
listen
let
me
go
he
said
miserably
ill
come
you
later
i
must
just
send
my
assistant
my
wife
she
alone
you
know
abogin
did
not
speak
carriage
swaying
from
side
side
crunching
over
stones
drove
sandy
bank
rolled
its
way
kirilov
moved
restlessly
looked
about
him
misery
behind
them
dim
light
stars
road
could
seen
riverside
willows
vanishing
into
darkness
right
lay
plain
uniform
boundless
sky
here
there
distance
probably
peat
marshes
dim
lights
were
glimmering
left
parallel
with
road
ran
hill
tufted
with
small
bushes
above
hill
stood
motionless
big
red
half
moon
slightly
veiled
with
mist
encircled
by
tiny
clouds
which
seemed
looking
round
it
from
sides
watching
that
it
did
not
go
away
nature
there
seemed
feeling
hopelessness
pain
earth
like
ruined
woman
sitting
alone
dark
room
trying
not
think
past
was
brooding
over
memories
spring
summer
apathetically
waiting
inevitable
winter
wherever
one
looked
sides
nature
seemed
like
dark
infinitely
deep
cold
pit
from
which
neither
kirilov
nor
abogin
nor
red
half
moon
could
escape
nearer
carriage
got
its
goal
more
impatient
abogin
became
he
kept
moving
leaping
looking
over
coachmans
shoulder
when
last
carriage
stopped
before
entrance
which
was
elegantly
curtained
with
striped
linen
when
he
looked
lighted
windows
second
storey
there
was
an
audible
catch
breath
if
anything
happens
i
shall
not
survive
it
he
said
going
into
hall
with
doctor
rubbing
hands
agitation
but
there
commotion
so
everything
must
going
well
so
far
he
added
listening
stillness
there
was
sound
hall
steps
or
voices
house
seemed
asleep
spite
lighted
windows
now
doctor
abogin
who
till
then
been
darkness
could
see
each
other
clearly
doctor
was
tall
stooped
was
untidily
dressed
not
good
looking
there
was
an
unpleasantly
harsh
morose
unfriendly
look
about
lips
thick
negros
aquiline
nose
listless
apathetic
eyes
unkempt
head
sunken
temples
premature
greyness
long
narrow
beard
through
which
chin
was
visible
pale
grey
hue
skin
careless
uncouth
manners
harshness
this
was
suggestive
years
poverty
ill
fortune
weariness
with
life
with
men
looking
frigid
figure
one
could
hardly
believe
that
this
man
wife
that
he
was
capable
weeping
over
child
abogin
presented
very
different
appearance
he
was
thick
set
sturdy
looking
fair
man
with
big
head
large
soft
features
he
was
elegantly
dressed
very
latest
fashion
carriage
closely
buttoned
coat
long
hair
face
there
was
suggestion
something
generous
leonine
he
walked
with
head
erect
chest
squared
he
spoke
an
agreeable
baritone
there
was
shade
refined
almost
feminine
elegance
manner
which
he
took
off
scarf
smoothed
hair
even
paleness
childlike
terror
with
which
he
looked
stairs
he
took
off
coat
did
not
detract
from
dignity
nor
diminish
air
sleekness
health
aplomb
which
characterized
whole
figure
there
nobody
sound
he
said
going
stairs
there
commotion
god
grant
well
he
led
doctor
through
hall
into
big
drawing
room
where
there
was
black
piano
chandelier
white
cover
from

they
both
went
into
very
snug
pretty
little

full
an
agreeable
rosy
twilight

agreeably
subdued
light
own
presence
strangers
unfamiliar
house

something
character
an
adventure
did
not
apparently
affect
him
he
sat

were
burnt
with
carbolic

only
caught
passing
glimpse
bright
red

he
noticed
stuffed

substantial
sleek

uttered
loud
exclamation

muttered
doctor
why
whats
meaning
it
why
its
an
outrage
personal
dignity
mockery
human
suffering
its
incredible
its
first
time
my
life
i
such
an
experience
with
dull
surprise
man
who
only
just
realized
that
he
been
bitterly
insulted
doctor
shrugged
shoulders
flung
wide
arms
not
knowing
what
or
say
sank
helplessly
into
chair
if
you
ceased
love
me
love
another
so
it
but
why
this
deceit
why
this
vulgar
treacherous
trick
abogin
said
tearful
voice
what
object
it
what
there
justify
it
what
i
done
you
listen
doctor
he
said
hotly
going
kirilov
you
been
involuntary
witness
my
misfortune
i
not
going
conceal
truth
from
you
i
swear
that
i
loved
woman
loved
devotedly
like
slave
i
sacrificed
everything
i
quarrelled
with
my
own
people
i
given
service
music
i
forgiven
what
i
could
not
forgiven
my
own
mother
or
sister
i
never
looked
askance
i
never
gainsaid
anything
why
this
deception
i
not
demand
love
but
why
this
loathsome
duplicity
if
she
did
not
love
me
why
did
she
not
say
so
openly
honestly
especially
she
knows
my
views
subject
with
tears
eyes
trembling
over
abogin
opened
heart
doctor
with
perfect
sincerity
he
spoke
warmly
pressing
both
hands
heart
exposing
secrets
private
life
without
faintest
hesitation
even
seemed
glad
that
last
these
secrets
were
longer
pent
breast
if
he
talked
this
way
an
hour
or
two
opened
heart
he
would
undoubtedly
felt
better
who
knows
if
doctor
listened
him
sympathized
with
him
like
friend
he
might
perhaps
often
happens
reconciled
himself
trouble
without
protest
without
doing
anything
needless
absurd
but
what
happened
was
quite
different
while
abogin
was
speaking
outraged
doctor
perceptibly
changed
indifference
wonder
face
gradually
gave
way
an
expression
bitter
resentment
indignation
anger
features
face
became
even
harsher
coarser
more
unpleasant
when
abogin
held
out
before
eyes
photograph
young
woman
with
handsome
face
cold
expressionless
nuns
asked
him
whether
looking
that
face
one
could
conceive
that
it
was
capable
duplicity
doctor
suddenly
flew
out
with
flashing
eyes
said
rudely
rapping
out
each
word
what
you
telling
me
this
i
desire
hear
it
i
desire
he
shouted
brought
fist
down
table
i
dont
want
your
vulgar
secrets
damnation
take
them
dont
dare
tell
me
such
vulgar
doings
you
consider
that
i
not
been
insulted
enough
already
that
i
flunkey
whom
you
insult
without
restraint
that
it
abogin
staggered
back
from
kirilov
stared
him
amazement
why
did
you
bring
me
here
doctor
went
beard
quivering
if
you
so
puffed
with
good
living
that
you
go
get
married
then
act
farce
like
this
how
i
come
what
i
with
your
love
affairs
leave
me
peace
go
squeezing
money
out
poor
your
gentlemanly
way
make
display
humane
ideas
play
doctor
looked
sideways
violoncello
case
play
bassoon
trombone
grow
fat
capons
but
dont
dare
insult
personal
dignity
if
you
cannot
respect
it
you
might
least
spare
it
your
attention
excuse
me
what
does
this
mean
abogin
asked
flushing
red
it
means
that
its
base
low
play
with
people
like
this
i
doctor
you
look
upon
doctors
people
generally
who
work
dont
stink
perfume
prostitution
your
menials
mauvais

well
you
may
look
upon
them
so
but

man
who
suffering
stage
property
how
dare
you
say
that
me
abogin
said
quietly
face
began
working
again
this
time
unmistakably
from
anger
how
dared
you
knowing
my
sorrow
bring
me
here
listen
these
vulgarities
shouted
doctor
he
again
banged
table
with
fist
who
given
you
right
make
mockery
another
mans
sorrow
you
taken
leave
your
senses
shouted
abogin
it
ungenerous
i
intensely
unhappy
myself
unhappy
said
doctor
with
smile
contempt
dont
utter
that
word
it
does
not
concern
you
spendthrift
who
cannot
raise
loan
calls
himself
unhappy
too
capon
sluggish
from

unhappy
too
worthless
people
sir

shrieked
abogin
saying

two

dilating

shouted
doctor
he
brushed

off

floor
an
insult
cannot

abogin
doctor
stood
face
face
their
wrath
continued
flinging
undeserved
insults
each
other
i
believe
that
never
their
lives
even
delirium
they
uttered
so
much
that
was
unjust
cruel
absurd
egoism
unhappy
was
conspicuous
both
unhappy
egoistic
spiteful
unjust
cruel
less
capable
understanding
each
other
than
fools
unhappiness
does
not
bring
people
together
but
draws
them
apart
even
where
one
would
fancy
people
should
united
by
similarity
their
sorrow
far
more
injustice
cruelty
generated
than
comparatively
placid
surroundings
kindly
let
me
go
home
shouted
doctor
breathing
hard
abogin
rang
bell
sharply
when
one
came

rang
again

abogin
doctor
remained
silence
waiting
carriage
first
regained
expression
sleekness
refined
elegance
he
paced
down
room
tossed
head
elegantly
was
evidently
meditating
something
anger
not
cooled
but
he
tried
appear
not

enemy
doctor
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
edge
table
looked
abogin
with
that
profound
somewhat
cynical
ugly
contempt
only
found
eyes
sorrow
indigence
when
they
confronted
with
well
nourished
comfort
elegance
when
little
later
doctor
got
into

was
dark
much
darker
than

been
an

before

guarding

lay
dark

thought
not

unjust
inhumanly
cruel
he
condemned

who
lived
rosy
subdued

among
sweet
perfumes
way
home
he
hated
despised
them
till
head
ached
firm
conviction
concerning
those
people
took
shape
mind
time
will
pass
kirilovs
sorrow
will
pass
but
that
conviction
unjust
unworthy
human
heart
will
not
pass
but
will
remain

grave
