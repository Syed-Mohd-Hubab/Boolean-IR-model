opinion
a
very
celebrated
and
great
man
hang
under

in
a
gilt
frame
and
there
also
is
a
portrait
of
father
aristark
to
whom
the
lady
owes
her
salvation
that
is
the
renunciation
of
pernicious
allopathy
and
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
in
the
vestibule
patients
are
sitting
waiting
for
the
most
part
peasants
all
but
two
or
three
of
them
are
barefoot
as
the
lady
has
given
orders
that
their
ill
smelling
boots
are
to
be
left
in
the
yard
marfa

patients
when
she
calls

eleventh
gavrila
gruzd

door
opens
and
instead
of
gavrila
gruzd
zamuhrishen
a
neighbouring
landowner
who
has
sunk
into
poverty
a
little
old
man
with
sour
eyes
and
with
a
gentlemans
cap
under
his
arm
walks
into
the
room
he
puts
down
his
stick
in
the
corner
goes
up
to
the
lady
and
without
a
word
drops
on
one
knee
before
her
what
are
you
about
kuzma
kuzmitch
cries
the
lady
in
horror
flushing
crimson
for
goodness
sake
while
i
live
i
will
not
rise
says
zamuhrishen
bending
over
her
hand
let
all
the
world
see
my
homage
on
my
knees
our
guardian
angel
benefactress
of
the
human
race
let
them
before
the
good
fairy
who
has
given
me
life
guided
me
into
the
path
of
truth
and
enlightened
my
scepticism
i
am
ready
not
merely
to
kneel
but
to
pass
through
fire
our
miraculous
healer
mother
of
the
orphan
and
the
widowed
i
have
recovered
i
am
a
new
man
enchantress
i
i
am
very
glad
mutters
the
lady
flushing
with
pleasure
its
so
pleasant
to
hear
that
sit
down
please
why
you
were
so
seriously
ill
that
tuesday
yes
indeed
how
ill
i
was
its
awful
to
recall
it
says
zamuhrishen
taking
a
seat
i
had
rheumatism
in
every
part
and
every
organ
i
have
been
in
misery
for
eight
years
ive
had
no
rest
from
it
by
day
or
by
night
my
benefactress
i
have
consulted
doctors
and
i
went
to
professors
at
kazan
i
have
tried
all
sorts
of
mudbaths
and
drunk
waters
and
goodness
knows
what
i
havent
tried
i
have
wasted
all
my
substance
on
doctors
my
beautiful
lady
the
doctors
did
me
nothing
but
harm
they
drove
the
disease
inwards
drive
in
that
they
did
but
to
drive
out
was
beyond
their
science
all
they
care
about
is
their
fees
the
brigands
but
as
for
the
benefit
of
humanityfor
that
they
dont
care
a
straw
they
prescribe
some
quackery
and
you
have
to
drink
it
assassins
thats
the
only
word
for
them
if
it
hadnt
been
for
you
our
angel
i
should
have
been
in
the
grave
by
now
i
went
home
from
you
that
tuesday
looked
at
the
pilules
that
you
gave
me
then
and
wondered
what
good
there
could
be
in
them
was
it
possible
that
those
little
grains
scarcely
visible
could
cure
my
immense
longstanding
disease
thats
what
i
thoughtunbeliever
that
i
wasand
i
smiled
but
when
i
took
the
piluleit
was
instantaneous
it
was
as
though
i
had
not
been
ill
or
as
though
it
had
been
lifted
off
me
my
wife
looked
at
me
with
her
eyes
starting
out
of
her
head
and
couldnt
believe
it
why
is
it
you
kolya
yes
it
is
i
i
said
and
we
knelt
down
together
before
the
ikon
and
fell
to
praying
for
our
angel
send
her
o
lord
all
that
we
are
feeling
zamuhrishen
wipes
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve
gets
up
from
his
chair
and
shows
a
disposition
to
drop
on
one
knee
again
but
the
lady
checks
him
and
makes
him
sit
down
its
not
me
you
must
thank
she
says
blushing
with
excitement
and
looking
enthusiastically
at
the
portrait
of
father
aristark
its
not
my
doing
i
am
only
the
obedient
instrument
its
really
a
miracle
rheumatism
of
eight
years
standing
by
one
pilule
of
scrofuloso
excuse
me
you
were
so
kind
as
to
give
me
three
pilules
one
i
took
at
dinner
and
the
effect
was
instantaneous
another
in
the
evening
and
the
third
next
day
and
since
then
not
a
touch
not
a
twinge
anywhere
and
you
know
i
thought
i
was
dying
i
had
written
to
moscow
for
my
son
to
come
the
lord
has
given
you
wisdom
our
lady
of
healing
now
i
am
walking
and
feel
as
though
i
were
in
paradise
the
tuesday
i
came
to
you
i
was
hobbling
and
now
i
am
ready
to
run
after
a
hare
i
could
live
for
a
hundred
years
theres
only
one
trouble
our
lack
of
means
im
well
now
but
whats
the
use
of
health
if
theres
nothing
to
live
on
poverty
weighs
on
me
worse
than
illness
for
example
take
this
its
the
time
to
sow
oats
and
how
is
one
to
sow
it
if
one
has
no
seed
i
ought
to
buy
it
but
the
money

knows
how
we
are
off
for
money
i
will
give
you
oats
kuzma
kuzmitch
sit
down
sit
down
you
have
so
delighted
me
you
have
given
me
so
much
pleasure
that
its
not
you
but
i
that
should
say
thank
you
you
are
our
joy
that
the
lord
should
create
such
goodness
rejoice
madam
looking
at
your
good
deeds
while
we
sinners
have
no
cause
for
rejoicing
in
ourselves
we
are
paltry
poorspirited
useless
people
a
mean
lot
we
are
only
gentry
in
name
but
in
a
material
sense
we
are
the
same
as
peasants
only
worse
we
live
in
stone
houses
but
its
a
mere
makebelieve
for
the
roof
leaks
and
there
is
no
money
to
buy
wood
to
mend
it
with
ill
give
you
the
wood
kuzma
kuzmitch
zamuhrishen
asks
for
and
gets
a
cow
too
a
letter
of
recommendation
for
his
daughter
whom
he
wants
to
send
to
a
boarding
school
and
touched
by
the
ladys
liberality
he
whimpers
with
excess
of
feeling
twists
his
mouth
and
feels
in
his
pocket
for
his
handkerchief
marfa
petrovna
sees
a
red
paper
slip
out
of
his
pocket
with
his
handkerchief
and
fall
noiselessly
to
the
floor
i
shall
never
forget
it
to
all
eternity
he
mutters
and
i
shall
make
my
children
and
my
grandchildren
remember
it
from
generation
to
generation
see
children
i
shall
say
who
has
saved
me
from
the
grave
who
when
she
has
seen
her
patient
out
the
lady
looks
for
a
minute
at
father
aristark
with
eyes
full
of
tears
then
turns
her
caressing
reverent
gaze
on
the
drug
chest
the
books
the
bills
the
armchair
in
which
the
man
she
had
saved
from
death
has
just
been
sitting
and
her
eyes
fall
on
the
paper
just
dropped
by
her
patient
she
picks
up
the
paper
unfolds
it
and
sees
in
it
three
pilulesthe
very
pilules
she
had
given
zamuhrishen
the
previous
tuesday
they
are
the
very
ones
she
thinks
puzzled
the
paper
is
the
same
he
hasnt
even
unwrapped
them
what
has
he
taken
then
strange
surely
he
wouldnt
try
to
deceive
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
ten
years
of
practice
a
doubt
creeps
into
marfa
petrovnas
mind
she
summons
the
other
patients
and
while
talking
to
them
of
their
complaints
notices
what
has
hitherto
slipped
by
her
ears
unnoticed
the
patients
every
one
of
them
as
though
they
were
in
a
conspiracy
first
belaud
her
for
their
miraculous
cure
go
into
raptures
over
her
medical
skill
and
abuse
allopath
doctors
then
when
she
is
flushed
with
excitement
begin
holding
forth
on
their
needs
one
asks
for
a
bit
of
land
to
plough
another
for
wood
a
third
for
permission
to
shoot
in
her
forests
and
so
on
she
looks
at
the
broad
benevolent
countenance
of
father
aristark
who
has
revealed
the
truth
to
her
and
a
new
truth
begins
gnawing
at
her
heart
an
evil
oppressive
truth
the
deceitfulness
of
man
