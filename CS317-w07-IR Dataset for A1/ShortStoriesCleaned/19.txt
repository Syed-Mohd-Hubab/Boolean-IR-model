white
elephant
yes
whose
fault
it
says
ivan
alexyevitch
stretching
long
legs
thrusting
out
feet
with
their
very
pointed
toes
if
you
not
happy
its
your
own
fault
yes

man
creator
own
happiness
if

obstinately
turn
away
from

why
what
next
how
you
make
that
out
very
simply
nature
ordained
that
certain
stage
life
man
should
love
when
that
time
comes
you
should
love
like
house
fire
but
you
wont
heed
dictates
nature
you
keep
waiting
something
whats
more
its
laid
down
by
law

normal
man
should
enter
upon
matrimony
theres
happiness
without

when
propitious
moment
come
get
married
theres
use
shilly
shallying

maketh
glad
heart
