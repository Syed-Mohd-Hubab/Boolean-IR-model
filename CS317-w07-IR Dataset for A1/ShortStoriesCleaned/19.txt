a
happy
man
the
passenger
train
is
just
starting
from
bologoe
the
junction
on
the
petersburg
moscow
line
in
a
second
class
smoking
compartment
five
passengers
sit
dozing
shrouded
in
the
twilight
of
the
carriage
they
had
just
had
a
meal
and
now
snugly
ensconced
in
their
seats
they
are
trying
to
go
to
sleep
stillness
the
door
opens
and
in
there
walks
a
tall
lanky
figure
straight
as
a
poker
with
a
ginger
coloured
hat
and
a
smart
overcoat
wonderfully
suggestive
of
a
journalist
in
jules
verne
or
on
the
comic
stage
the
figure
stands
still
in
the
middle
of
the
compartment
for
a
long
while
breathing
heavily
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
peering
at
the
seats
no
wrong
again
he
mutters
what
the
deuce
its
positively
revolting
no
the
wrong
one
again
one
of
the
passengers
stares
at
the
figure
and
utters
a
shout
of
joy
ivan
alexyevitch
what
brings
you
here
is
it
you
the
poker
like
gentleman
starts
stares
blankly
at
the
passenger
and
recognizing
him
claps
his
hands
with
delight
ha
pyotr
petrovitch
he
says
how
many
summers
how
many
winters
i
didnt
know
you
were
in
this
train
how
are
you
getting
on
i
am
all
right

only
thing

my
dear
fellow
ive
lost
my
compartment
and
i
simply
cant
find
it
what
an
idiot
i
am
i
ought
to
be
thrashed
the
poker
like
gentleman
sways
a
little
unsteadily
and
sniggers
queer
things
do
happen
he
continues
i
stepped
out
just
after
the
second
bell
to
get
a
glass
of
brandy
i
got
it
of
course
well
i
thought
since
its
a
long
way
to
the
next
station
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
a
second
glass
while
i
was
thinking
about
it
and
drinking
it
the
third
bell
rang
i
ran
like
mad
and
jumped
into
the
first
carriage
i
am
an
idiot
i
am
the
son
of
a
hen
but
you
seem
in
very
good
spirits

ivan
alexyevitch
heaves
a
sigh
and
irresolutely
sits
down
facing
pyotr
petrovitch
he
is
visibly
excited
and
fidgets
as
though
he
were
sitting
on
thorns
where
are
you
travelling
to
pyotr
petrovitch
enquires
i
into
space
there
is
such
a
turmoil
in
my
head
that
i
couldnt
tell
where
i
am
going
myself
i
go
where
fate
takes
me

idiot

wedding
congratulations
and
the
usual
questions

well
you
are
a
fellow
laughs
pyotr
petrovitch
thats
why
you
are
rigged
out
such
a
dandy
yes
indeed
to
complete
the
illusion
ive
even
sprinkled
myself
with
scent
i
am
over
my
ears
in
vanity
no
care
no
thought
nothing
but
a
sensation
of
something
or
other
deuce
knows
what
to
call
it
beatitude
or
something
ive
never
felt
so
grand
in
my
life
ivan
alexyevitch
shuts
his
eyes
and
waggles
his
head
im
revoltingly
happy
he
says
just
think
in
a
minute
i
shall
go
to
my
compartment
there
on
the
seat
near
the
window
is
sitting
a
being
who
is
so
to
say
devoted
to
you
with
her
whole
being
a
little
blonde
with
a
little
nose
little
fingers
my
little
darling
my
angel
my
little
poppet
phylloxera
of
my
soul
and
her
little
foot
good
god
a
little
foot
not
like
our
beetle
crushers
but
something
miniature
fairylike
allegorical
i
could
pick
it
up
and
eat
it
that
little
foot
oh
but
you
dont
understand
youre
a
materialist
of
course
you
begin
analyzing
at
once
and
one
thing
and
another
you
are
cold
hearted
bachelors
thats
what
you
are
when
you
get
married
youll
think
of
me
wheres
ivan
alexyevitch
now
youll
say
yes
so
in
a
minute
im
going
to
my
compartment
there
she
is
waiting
for
me
with
impatience
in
joyful
anticipation
of
my
appearance
shell
have
a
smile
to
greet
me
i
sit
down
beside
her
and
take
her
chin
with
my
two
fingers
ivan
alexyevitch
waggles
his
head
and
goes
off
into
a
chuckle
of
delight
then
i
lay
my
noddle
on
her
shoulder
and
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
around
all
is
silence
you
know
poetic
twilight
i
could
embrace
the
whole
world
at
such
a
moment
pyotr
petrovitch
allow
me
to
embrace
you
delighted
im
sure
the
two
friends
embrace
while
the
passengers
laugh
in
chorus
and
the
happy
bridegroom
continues
and
to
complete
the
idiocy
or
as
the
novelists
say
to
complete
the
illusion
one
goes
to
the
refreshment
room
and
tosses
off
two
or
three
glasses
and
then
something
happens
in
your
head
and
your
heart
finer
than
you
can
read
of
in
a
fairy
tale
i
am
a
man
of
no
importance
but
i
feel
as
though
i
were
limitless
i
embrace
the
whole
world
the
passengers
looking
at
the
tipsy
and
blissful
bridegroom
are
infected
by
his
cheerfulness
and
no
longer
feel
sleepy
instead
of
one
listener
ivan
alexyevitch
has
now
an
audience
of
five
he
wriggles
and
splutters
gesticulates
and
prattles
on
without
ceasing
he
laughs
and
they
all
laugh
gentlemen
gentlemen
dont
think
so
much
damn
all
this
analysis
if
you
want
a
drink
drink
no
need
to
philosophize
as
to
whether
its
bad
for
you
or
not
damn
all
this
philosophy
and
psychology
the
guard
walks
through
the
compartment
my
dear
fellow
the
bridegroom
addresses
him
when
you
pass
through
the
carriage
no
look
out
for
a
lady
in
a
grey
hat
with
a
white
bird
and
tell
her
im
here
yes
sir
only
there
isnt
a
no
in
this
train
theres
well
then
its
all
the
same
tell
that
lady
then
that
her
husband
is
all
right
ivan
alexyevitch
suddenly
clutches
his
head
and
groans
husband
lady
all
in
a
minute
husband
ha
ha
i
am
a
puppy
that
needs
thrashing
and
here
i
am
a
husband
ach
idiot
but
think
of
her
yesterday
she
was
a
little
girl
a
midget
it
s
simply
incredible
nowadays
it
really
seems
strange
to
see
a
happy
man
observes
one
of
the
passengers
one
as
soon
expects
to
see
a
white
elephant
yes
and
whose
fault
is
it
says
ivan
alexyevitch
stretching
his
long
legs
and
thrusting
out
his
feet
with
their
very
pointed
toes
if
you
are
not
happy
its
your
own
fault
yes
what
else
do
you
suppose
it
is
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
if
you
want
to
be
happy
you
will
be
but
you
dont
want
to
be
you
obstinately
turn
away
from
happiness
why
what
next
how
do
you
make
that
out
very
simply
nature
has
ordained
that
at
a
certain
stage
in
his
life
man
should
love
when
that
time
comes
you
should
love
like
a
house
on
fire
but
you
wont
heed
the
dictates
of
nature
you
keep
waiting
for
something
whats
more
its
laid
down
by
law
that
the
normal
man
should
enter
upon
matrimony
theres
no
happiness
without
marriage
when
the
propitious
moment
has
come
get
married
theres
no
use
in
shilly
shallying
but
you
dont
get
married
you
keep
waiting
for
something
then
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
wine
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
if
you
feel
happy
and
you
want
to
feel
better
still
then
go
to
the
refreshment
bar
and
have
a
drink
the
great
thing
is
not
to
be
too
clever
but
to
follow
the
beaten
track
the
beaten
track
is
a
grand
thing
you
say
that
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
how
the
devil
is
he
the
creator
of
it
when
a
toothache
or
an
ill
natured
mother
in
law
is
enough
to
scatter
his
happiness
to
the
winds
everything
depends
on
chance
if
we
had
an
accident
at
this
moment
youd
sing
a
different
tune
stuff
and
nonsense
retorts
the
bridegroom
railway
accidents
only
happen
once
a
year
im
not
afraid
of
an
accident
for
there
is
no
reason
for
one
accidents
are
exceptional
confound
them
i
dont
want
to
talk
of
them
oh
i
believe
were
stopping
at
a
station
where
are
you
going
now
asks
pyotr
petrovitch
to
moscow
or
somewhere
further
south
why
bless
you
how
could
i
go
somewhere
further
south
when
im
on
my
way
to
the
north
but
moscow
isnt
in
the
north
i
know
that
but
were
on
our
way
to
petersburg
says
ivan
alexyevitch
we
are
going
to
moscow
mercy
on
us
to
moscow
what
do
you
mean
says
the
bridegroom
in
amazement
its
queer
for
what
station
did
you
take
your
ticket
for
petersburg
in
that
case
i
congratulate
you
youve
got
into
the
wrong
train
there
follows
a
minute
of
silence
the
bridegroom
gets
up
and
looks
blankly
round
the
company
yes
yes
pyotr
petrovitch
explains
you
must
have
jumped
into
the
wrong
train
at
bologoe
after
your
glass
of
brandy
you
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
down
train
ivan
alexyevitch
turns
pale
clutches
his
head
and
begins
pacing
rapidly
about
the
carriage
ach
idiot
that
i
am
he
says
in
indignation
scoundrel
the
devil
devour
me
whatever
am
i
to
do
now
why
my
wife
is
in
that
train
shes
there
all
alone
expecting
me
consumed
by
anxiety
ach
im
a
motley
fool
the
bridegroom
falls
on
the
seat
and
writhes
as
though
someone
had
trodden
on
his
corns
i
am
un
unhappy
man
he
moans
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
there
there
the
passengers
try
to
console
him
its
all
right
you
must
telegraph
to
your
wife
and
try
to
change
into
the
petersburg
express
in
that
way
youll
overtake
her
the
petersburg
express
weeps
the
bridegroom
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
and
how
am
i
to
get
a
ticket
for
the
petersburg
express
all
my
money
is
with
my
wife
the
passengers
laughing
and
whispering
together
make
a
collection
and
furnish
the
happy
man
with
funds
