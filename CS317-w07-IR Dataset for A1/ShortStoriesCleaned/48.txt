in
an
hotel
let
me
tell
you
my
good
man
began
madame
nashatyrin
the
colonels
lady
at
no
crimson
and
spluttering
as
she
pounced
on
the
hotel
keeper
either
give
me
other
apartments
or
i
shall
leave
your
confounded
hotel
altogether
its
a
sink
of
iniquity
mercy
on
us
i
have
grownup
daughters
and
one
hears
nothing
but
abominations
day
and
night
its
beyond
everything
day
and
night
sometimes
he
fires
off
such
things
that
it
simply
makes
ones
ears
blush
positively
like
a
cabman
its
a
good
thing
that
my
poor
girls
dont
understand
or
i
should
have
to
fly
out
into
the
street
with
them
hes
saying
something
now
you
listen
i
know
a
thing
better
than
that
my
boy
a
husky
bass
floated
in
from
the
next
room
do
you
remember
lieutenant
druzhkov
well
that
same
druzhkov
was
one
day
making
a
drive
with
the
yellow
into
the
pocket
and
as
he
usually
did
you
know
flung
up
his
leg
all
at
once
something
went
crrrack
at
first
they
thought
he
had
torn
the
cloth
of
the
billiard
table
but
when
they
looked
my
dear
fellow
his
united
states
had
split
at
every
seam
he
had
made
such
a
high
kick
the
beast
that
not
a
seam
was
left
hahaha
and
there
were
ladies
present
too
among
others
the
wife
of
that
drivelling
lieutenant
okurin
okurin
was
furious
how
dare
the
fellow
said
he
behave
with
impropriety
in
the
presence
of
my
wife
one
thing
led
to
another
you
know
our
fellows
okurin
sent
seconds
to
druzhkov
and
druzhkov
said
dont
be
a
fool
hahaha
but
tell
him
he
had
better
send
seconds
not
to
me
but
to
the
tailor
who
made
me
those
breeches
it
is
his
fault
you
know
hahaha
hahaha
lilya
and
mila
the
colonels
daughters
who
were
sitting
in
the
window
with
their
round
cheeks
propped
on
their
fists
flushed
crimson
and
dropped
their
eyes
that
looked
buried
in
their
plump
faces
now
you
have
heard
him
havent
you
madame
nashatyrin
went
on
addressing
the
hotelkeeper
and
that
you
consider
of
no
consequence
i
suppose
i
am
the
wife
of
a
colonel
sir
my
husband
is
a
commanding
officer
i
will
not
permit
some
cabman
to
utter
such
infamies
almost
in
my
presence
he
is
not
a
cabman
madam
but
the
staffcaptain
kikin
a
gentleman
born
if
he
has
so
far
forgotten
his
station
as
to
express
himself
like
a
cabman
then
he
is
even
more
deserving
of
contempt
in
short
dont
answer
me
but
kindly
take
steps
but
what
can
i
do
madam
you
are
not
the
only
one
to
complain
everybodys
complaining
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
him
one
goes
to
his
room
and
begins
putting
him
to
shame
saying
hannibal
ivanitch
have
some
fear
of
god
its
shameful
and
hell
punch
you
in
the
face
with
his
fists
and
say
all
sorts
of
things
there
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
and
such
like
its
a
disgrace
he
wakes
up
in
the
morning
and
sets
to
walking
about
the
corridor
in
nothing
saving
your
presence
but
his
underclothes
and
when
he
has
had
a
drop
he
will
pick
up
a
revolver
and
set
to
putting
bullets
into
the
wall
by
day
he
is
swilling
liquor
and
at
night
he
plays
cards
like
mad
and
after
cards
it
is
fighting
i
am
ashamed
for
the
other
lodgers
to
see
it
why
dont
you
get
rid
of
the
scoundrel
why
theres
no
getting
him
out
he
owes
me
for
three
months
but
we
dont
ask
for
our
money
we
simply
ask
him
to
get
out
as
a
favour
the
magistrate
has
given
him
an
order
to
clear
out
of
the
rooms
but
hes
taking
it
from
one
court
to
another
and
so
it
drags
on
hes
a
perfect
nuisance
thats
what
he
is
and
good
lord
such
a
man
too
young
goodlooking
and
intellectual
when
he
hasnt
had
a
drop
you
couldnt
wish
to
see
a
nicer
gentleman
the
other
day
he
wasnt
drunk
and
he
spent
the
whole
day
writing
letters
to
his
father
and
mother
poor
father
and
mother
sighed
the
colonels
lady
they
are
to
be
pitied
to
be
sure
theres
no
comfort
in
having
such
a
scamp
hes
sworn
at
and
turned
out
of
his
lodgings
and
not
a
day
passes
but
he
is
in
trouble
over
some
scandal
its
sad
his
poor
unhappy
wife
sighed
the
lady
he
has
no
wife
madam
a
likely
idea
she
would
have
to
thank
god
if
her
head
were
not
broken
the
lady
walked
up
and
down
the
room
he
is
not
married
you
say
certainly
not
madam
the
lady
walked
up
and
down
the
room
again
and
mused
a
little
hm
not
married
she
pronounced
meditatively
hm
lilya
and
mila
dont
sit
at
the
window
theres
a
draught
what
a
pity
a
young
man
and
to
let
himself
sink
to
this
and
all
owing
to
what
the
lack
of
good
influence
there
is
no
mother
who
would
not
married
well
there
it
is
please
be
so
good
the
lady
continued
suavely
after
a
moments
thought
as
to
go
to
him
and
ask
him
in
my
name
to
refrain
from
using
expressions
tell
him
that
madame
nashatyrin
begs
him
tell
him
she
is
staying
with
her
daughters
in
no
that
she
has
come
up
from
her
estate
in
the
country
certainly
tell
him
a
colonels
lady
and
her
daughters
he
might
even
come
and
apologize
we
are
always
at
home
after
dinner
oh
mila
shut
the
window
why
what
do
you
want
with
that
black
sheep
mamma
drawled
lilya
when
the
hotelkeeper
had
retired
a
queer
person
to
invite
a
drunken
rowdy
rascal
oh
dont
say
so
ma
chre
you
always
talk
like
that
and
there
sit
down
why
whatever
he
may
be
we
ought
not
to
despise
him
theres
something
good
in
everyone
who
knows
sighed
the
colonels
lady
looking
her
daughters
up
and
down
anxiously
perhaps
your
fate
is
here
change
your
dresses
anyway
