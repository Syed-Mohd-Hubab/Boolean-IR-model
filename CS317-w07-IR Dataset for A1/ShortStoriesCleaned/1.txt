she
moved
sideways
like
snake
though
she
wanted
steal
someone
strike
him
from
behind
she
tapped
rapidly
with
bare
heels
merik
done
with
heels
boots
then
she
turned
round
round
like
top
crouched
down
red
dress
was
blown
out
like
bell
merik
looking
angrily
showing
teeth
grin
flew
towards
same
crouching
posture
though
he
wanted
crush
with
terrible
legs
while
she
jumped
flung
back
head
waving
arms
big
bird
does
its
wings
floated
across
room
scarcely
touching
floor
what
flame
girl
thought
yergunov
sitting
chest
from
there
watching
dance
what
fire
give
everything
it
would
too
little
he
regretted
that
he
was
hospital
assistant
not
simple
peasant
that
he
wore
reefer
coat
chain
with
gilt
key
it
instead
blue
shirt
with
cord
tied
round
waist
then
he
could
boldly
sung
danced
flung
both

beads
were
scattered
over
floor
green
kerchief
slipped
off
lyubka
was
transformed
into
red
cloud
flitting
by
flashing
black
eyes
it
seemed
though
another
second
meriks
arms
legs
would
drop
off
but
finally
merik
stamped
last
time
stood
still
though
turned
stone
exhausted
almost
breathless
lyubka
sank
bosom
leaned
against
him
against
post
he
put
arms
round
looking
into
eyes

grass
bushes
while

country
huge
giants
white

sides
seeing
light
but
there
was
trace
horse
shouting
waving
arms
dogs
stumbling
over
drifts
sticking
snow
he
ran
out
gate
fell
gazing
into
darkness
he
strained
eyes
utmost
saw
only
snow
flying
snowflakes
distinctly
forming
into
sorts
shapes
one
moment
white
laughing
face
corpse
would
peep
out
darkness
next
white
horse
would
gallop
by
with
an
amazon
muslin
dress
upon
it
next
string
white
swans
would
fly
overhead
shaking
with
anger
cold
not
knowing
what
yergunov
fired
revolver
dogs
did
not
hit
one
them
then
he
rushed
back
house
when
he
went
into
entry
he
distinctly
heard
someone
scurry
out
room
bang
door
it
was
dark
room
yergunov
pushed
against
door
it
was
locked
then
lighting
match
after
match
he
rushed
back
into
entry
from
there
into
kitchen
from
kitchen
into
little
room
where
walls
were
hung
with
petticoats
dresses
where
there
was
smell
cornflowers
fennel
bedstead
with
perfect
mountain
pillows
standing
corner
by
stove
this
must
been
old
mothers
room
from
there
he
passed
into
another
little
room
here
he
saw
lyubka
she
was
lying
chest
covered
with
gay
coloured
patchwork
cotton
quilt
pretending
asleep
little
ikon
lamp
was
burning
corner
above
pillow
where
my
horse
yergunov
asked
lyubka
did
not
stir
where
my
horse
i
asking
you
yergunov
repeated
still
more
sternly
he
tore
quilt
off
i
asking
you
she
devil
he
shouted
she
jumped
knees
with
one
hand
holding
shift
with
other
trying
clutch
quilt
huddled
against
wall
she
looked
yergunov
with
repulsion
terror
eyes
like
wild
beast
trap
kept
cunning
watch
faintest
movement
tell
me
where
my
horse
or
ill
knock
life
out

shouted
yergunov
get
away
dirty
brute
she
said
hoarse
voice
yergunov
seized
by
shift
near
neck
tore
it
then
he
could
not
restrain
himself
with
might
embraced
girl
but
hissing
with
fury
she
slipped
out
arms
freeing
one
hand
other
was
tangled
torn
shift
hit
him
blow
with
fist
skull
head
was
dizzy
with
pain
there
was
ringing
rattling
ears
he
staggered
back
that
moment
received
another
blow
this
time
temple
reeling
clutching
doorposts
that
he
might
not
fall
he
made
way
room
where
things
were
lay
down
bench
then
after
lying
little
time
took
matchbox
out
pocket
began
lighting
match
after
match
object
he
lit
it
blew
it
out
threw
it
under
table
went
till
matches
were
gone
meanwhile
air
began
turn
blue
outside
cocks
began
crow
but
head
still
ached
there
was
an
uproar
ears
though
he
were
sitting
under
railway
bridge
hearing
trains
passing
over
head
he
got
somehow
into
coat
cap
saddle
bundle
purchases
he
could
not
find
knapsack
was
empty
it
was
not
nothing
that
someone
scurried
out
room
when
he
came
from
yard
he
took
poker
from
kitchen
keep
off
dogs
went
out
into
yard
leaving
door
open
snow
storm
subsided
it
was
calm
outside
when
he
went
out
gate
white
plain
looked
dead
there
was
not
single
bird
morning
sky
both
sides
road
distance
there
were
bluish
patches
young
copse
yergunov
began
thinking
how
he
would
greeted
hospital
what
doctor
would
say
him
it
was
absolutely
necessary
think
that
prepare
beforehand
answer
questions
he
would
asked
but
this
thought
grew
blurred
slipped
away
he
walked
along
thinking
nothing
but
lyubka
peasants
with
whom
he
passed
night
he
remembered
how
after
lyubka
struck
him
second
time
she
bent
down
floor
quilt
how
loose
hair
fallen
floor
mind
was
maze
he
wondered
why
there
were
world
doctors
hospital
assistants
merchants
clerks
peasants
instead
simple
free
men
there
sure
free
birds
free
beasts
free
merik
they
not
afraid
anyone
dont
need
anyone
whose
idea
was
it
who
decreed
that
one
must
get
morning
dine
midday
go
bed
evening
that
doctor
takes
precedence
hospital
assistant
that
one
must
live
rooms
love
only
ones
wife
why
not
contrary
dine
night
sleep
day
ah
jump
horse
without
enquiring
whose
it
ride
races
with
wind
like
devil
over
fields
forests
ravines
make
love
girls
mock
everyone
yergunov
thrust
poker
into
snow
pressed
forehead
cold
white
trunk
birch
tree
sank
into
thought
grey
monotonous
life
wages
subordinate
position
dispensary
everlasting
with
bottles
blisters
struck
him
contemptible
sickening
who
says
its
sin
enjoy
oneself
he
asked
himself
with
vexation
those
who
say
that
never
lived
freedom
like
merik
kalashnikov
never
loved
lyubka
they
been
beggars
their
lives
lived
without
any
pleasure
only
loved
their
wives
who
like
frogs
he
thought
about
himself
that
he
not
hitherto
been
thief
swindler
or
even
brigand
simply
because
he
could
not
or
not
yet
met
with
suitable
opportunity
year
half
passed
spring
after
easter
yergunov
who
long
before
been
dismissed
from
hospital
was
hanging
about
without
job
came
out
tavern
ryepino
sauntered
aimlessly
along
street
he
went
out
into
open
country
here
there
was
scent
spring
warm
caressing
wind
was
blowing
calm
starry
night
looked
down
from
sky
earth
my
god
how
infinite
depth
sky
with
what
fathomless
immensity
it
stretched
over
world
world
created
well
enough
only
why
with
what
right
people
thought
yergunov
divide
their
fellows
into
sober
drunken
employed
dismissed
so
why
sober
well
fed
sleep
comfortably
their
homes
while
drunken
hungry
must
wander
about
country
without
refuge
why
was
it
that
if
anyone
not
job
did
not
get
salary
he
go
hungry
without
clothes
boots
whose
idea
was
it
why
was
it
birds
wild
beasts
woods
did
not
jobs
get
salaries
but
lived
they
pleased
far
away
sky
beautiful
crimson
glow
lay
quivering
stretched
wide
over
horizon
yergunov
stopped
long
time
he
gazed
it
kept
wondering
why
was
it
that
if
he
carried
off
someone
elses
samovar
day
before
sold
it
drink
taverns
it
would
sin
why
was
it
two
carts
drove
by
road
one
them
there
was
woman
asleep
other
sat
an
old
man
without
cap
grandfather
where
that
fire
asked
yergunov
andrey
tchirikovs
inn
answered
old
man
yergunov
recalled
what
happened
him
eighteen
months
before
winter
that
very
inn
how
merik
boasted
he
imagined
old
woman
lyubka
with
their
throats
cut
burning
he
envied
merik
when
he
walked
back
tavern
looking
houses
rich
publicans
cattle
dealers
blacksmiths
he
reflected
how
nice
it
would
steal
by
night
into
some
rich
mans
house
