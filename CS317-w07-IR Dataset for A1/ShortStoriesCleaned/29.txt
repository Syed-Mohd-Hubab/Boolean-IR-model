into
study
after
taking
off
outer
garments
drinking
some
seltzer
water
he
settled

when
eyes
reached
middle
long
list
signatures
he
started

he
went
over
memory
acquaintances
relations
subordinates
service
recalled
remote
past
but
could
recollect
name
like
fedyukov
what
was
so
strange
was
that
this
incognito
fedyukov
signed
name
regularly
every
christmas
easter
last
thirteen
years
neither
navagin
wife
nor
house
porter
knew
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
or
what
he
was
like
its
extraordinary
navagin
thought
perplexity
he
paced
about
study
its
strange
incomprehensible
its
like
sorcery
call
porter
here
he
shouted
its
devilish
queer
but
i
will
find
out
who
he
i
say
grigory

said
addressing
porter
he
entered
that
fedyukov
signed
name
again

my
word
but
he
signed

there
been
fedyukov
here
that
i
will
swear
before
holy
image
its
queer
its
incomprehensible
its
ex
traordinary
mused
navagin
its
positively
ludicrous
man
been
signing
name
here
thirteen
years
you
cant
find
out
who
he
perhaps
its
joke
perhaps
some
clerk
writes
that
name
well
own
fun
navagin
began
examining
fedyukovs
signature
bold
florid
signature
old
fashioned
style
with
twirls
flourishes
was
utterly
unlike
handwriting
other
signatures
it
was
next
below
signature
shtutchkin
provincial
secretary
scared
timorous
little
man
who
would
certainly
died
fright
if
he
ventured
upon
such
an
impudent
joke
mysterious
fedyukov
signed
name
again
said
navagin
going
see
wife
again
i
fail
find
out
who
he
madame
navagin
was
spiritualist
so
phenomena
nature
comprehensible
or
incomprehensible
she
very
simple
explanation
theres
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
she
said
you
dont
believe
it
course
but
i
said
it
already
i
say
it
again
there
great
deal
world
that
supernatural
which
our
feeble
intellect
never
grasp
i
convinced
that
this
fedyukov
spirit
who
sympathy
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
call
him
ask
him
what
he
wants
nonsense
nonsense
navagin
was
free
from
superstitions
but
phenomenon
which
interested
him
was
so
mysterious
that
sorts
uncanny
devilry
intruded
into
mind
against
will
evening
he
was
imagining
that
incognito
fedyukov
was
spirit
some
long
dead
clerk
who
been
discharged
from
service
by
navagins
ancestors
was
now
revenging
himself
their
descendant
or
perhaps
it
was
kinsman
some
petty
official
dismissed
by
navagin
himself
or
girl
seduced
by
him
night
navagin
dreamed
gaunt
old
clerk
shabby
uniform
with
face
yellow
lemon
hair
that
stood
like
brush
pewtery
eyes
clerk
said
something
sepulchral
voice
shook
bony
finger
him
navagin
almost
an
attack
inflammation
brain
fortnight
he
was
silent
gloomy
kept
walking
down
thinking
end
he
overcame
sceptical
vanity
going
into
wifes
room
he
said
hollow
voice
zina
call
fedyukov
spiritualistic
lady
was
delighted
she
sent
sheet
cardboard
saucer

down
beside
began
upon

did
not
keep
them
waiting
long

what
were
you
earth
sinner
there
you

long
time
with
fedyukov
then
called
napoleon
hannibal
askotchensky
aunt
klavdya
zaharovna
they
gave
him
brief
but
correct
answers
full
deep
significance
he
was
busy
with
saucer
four
hours
fell
asleep
soothed
happy
that
he
become
acquainted
with
mysterious
world
that
was
new
him
after
that
he
studied
spiritualism
every
day
office
informed
clerks
that
there
was
great
deal
nature
that
was
supernatural
marvellous
which
our
men
science
ought
turned
their
attention
long
ago
hypnotism
mediumism
bishopism
spiritualism
fourth

misty
notions

complete
possession
him
