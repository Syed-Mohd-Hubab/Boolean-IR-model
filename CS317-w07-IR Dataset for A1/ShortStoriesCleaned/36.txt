ladies
fyodor
petrovitch
the
director
of
elementary
schools
in
the
n
district
who
considered
himself
a
just
and
generous
man
was
one
day
interviewing
in
his
office
a
schoolmaster
called
vremensky
no
mr
vremensky
he
was
saying
your
retirement
is
inevitable
you
cannot
continue
your
work
as
a
schoolmaster
with
a
voice
like
that
how
did
you
come
to
lose
it
i
drank
cold
beer
when
i
was
in
a
perspiration
hissed
the
schoolmaster
what
a
pity
after
a
man
has
served
fourteen
years
such
a
calamity
all
at
once
the
idea
of
a
career
being
ruined
by
such
a
trivial
thing
what
are
you
intending
to
do
now
the
schoolmaster
made
no
answer
are
you
a
family
man
asked
the
director
a
wife
and
two
children
your
excellency
hissed
the
schoolmaster
a
silence
followed
the
director
got
up
from
the
table
and
walked
to
and
fro
in
perturbation
i
cannot
think
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
you
he
said
a
teacher
you
cannot
be
and
you
are
not
yet
entitled
to
a
pension
to
abandon
you
to
your
fate
and
leave
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
is
rather
awkward
we
look
on
you
as
one
of
our
men
you
have
served
fourteen
years
so
it
is
our
business
to
help
you
but
how
are
we
to
help
you
what
can
i
do
for
you
put
yourself
in
my
place
what
can
i
do
for
you
a
silence
followed
the
director
walked
up
and
down
still
thinking
and
vremensky
overwhelmed
by
his
trouble
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
he
too
thought
all
at
once
the
director
began
beaming
and
even
snapped
his
fingers
i
wonder
i
did
not
think
of
it
before
he
began
rapidly
listen
this
is
what
i
can
offer
you
next
week
our
secretary
at
the
home
is
retiring
if
you
like
you
can
have
his
place
there
you
are
vremensky
not
expecting
such
good
fortune
beamed
too
thats
capital
said
the
director
write
the
application
today
dismissing
vremensky
fyodor
petrovitch
felt
relieved
and
even
gratified
the
bent
figure
of
the
hissing
schoolmaster
was
no
longer
confronting
him
and
it
was
agreeable
to
recognize
that
in
offering
a
vacant
post
to
vremensky
he
had
acted
fairly
and
conscientiously
like
a
goodhearted
and
thoroughly
decent
person
but
this
agreeable
state
of
mind
did
not
last
long
when
he
went
home
and
sat
down
to
dinner
his
wife
nastasya
ivanovna
said
suddenly
oh
yes
i
was
almost
forgetting
nina
sergeyevna
came
to
see
me
yesterday
and
begged
for
your
interest
on
behalf
of
a
young
man
i
am
told
there
is
a
vacancy
in
our
home
yes
but
the
post
has
already
been
promised
to
someone
else
said
the
director
and
he
frowned
and
you
know
my
rule
i
never
give
posts
through
patronage
i
know
but
for
nina
sergeyevna
i
imagine
you
might
make
an
exception
she
loves
us
as
though
we
were
relations
and
we
have
never
done
anything
for
her
and
dont
think
of
refusing
fedya
you
will
wound
both
her
and
me
with
your
whims
who
is
it
that
she
is
recommending
polzuhin
what
polzuhin
is
it
that
fellow
who
played
tchatsky
at
the
party
on
new
years
day
is
it
that
gentleman
not
on
any
account
the
director
left
off
eating
not
on
any
account
he
repeated
heaven
preserve
us
but
why
not
understand
my
dear
that
if
a
young
man
does
not
set
to
work
directly
but
through
women
he
must
be
good
for
nothing
why
doesnt
he
come
to
me
himself
after
dinner
the
director
lay
on
the
sofa
in
his
study
and
began
reading
the
letters
and
newspapers
he
had
received
dear
fyodor
petrovitch
wrote
the
wife
of
the
mayor
of
the
town
you
once
said
that
i
knew
the
human
heart
and
understood
people
now
you
have
an
opportunity
of
verifying
this
in
practice
k
n
polzuhin
whom
i
know
to
be
an
excellent
young
man
will
call
upon
you
in
a
day
or
two
to
ask
you
for
the
post
of
secretary
at
our
home
he
is
a
very
nice
youth
if
you
take
an
interest
in
him
you
will
be
convinced
of
it
and
so
on
on
no
account
was
the
directors
comment
heaven
preserve
me
after
that
not
a
day
passed
without
the
directors
receiving
letters
recommending
polzuhin
one
fine
morning
polzuhin
himself
a
stout
young
man
with
a
closeshaven
face
like
a
jockeys
in
a
new
black
suit
made
his
appearance
i
see
people
on
business
not
here
but
at
the
office
said
the
director
drily
on
hearing
his
request
forgive
me
your
excellency
but
our
common
acquaintances
advised
me
to
come
here
hm
growled
the
director
looking
with
hatred
at
the
pointed
toes
of
the
young
mans
shoes
to
the
best
of
my
belief
your
father
is
a
man
of
property
and
you
are
not
in
want
he
said
what
induces
you
to
ask
for
this
post
the
salary
is
very
trifling
its
not
for
the
sake
of
the
salary
its
a
government
post
any
way
hm
it
strikes
me
that
within
a
month
you
will
be
sick
of
the
job
and
you
will
give
it
up
and
meanwhile
there
are
candidates
for
whom
it
would
be
a
career
for
life
there
are
poor
men
for
whom
i
shant
get
sick
of
it
your
excellency
polzuhin
interposed
honour
bright
i
will
do
my
best
it
was
too
much
for
the
director
tell
me
he
said
smiling
contemptuously
why
was
it
you
didnt
apply
to
me
direct
but
thought
fitting
instead
to
trouble
ladies
as
a
preliminary
i
didnt
know
that
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
you
polzuhin
answered
and
he
was
embarrassed
but
your
excellency
if
you
attach
no
significance
to
letters
of
recommendation
i
can
give
you
a
testimonial
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
director
at
the
bottom
of
the
testimonial
which
was
written
in
official
language
and
handwriting
stood
the
signature
of
the
governor
everything
pointed
to
the
governors
having
signed
it
unread
simply
to
get
rid
of
some
importunate
lady
theres
nothing
for
it
i
bow
to
his
authority
i
obey
said
the
director
reading
the
testimonial
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
send
in
your
application
tomorrow
theres
nothing
to
be
done
and
when
polzuhin
had
gone
out
the
director
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
repulsion
sneak
he
hissed
pacing
from
one
corner
to
the
other
he
has
got
what
he
wanted
one
way
or
the
other
the
goodfornothing
toady
making
up
to
the
ladies
reptile
creature
the
director
spat
loudly
in
the
direction
of
the
door
by
which
polzuhin
had
departed
and
was
immediately
overcome
with
embarrassment
for
at
that
moment
a
lady
the
wife
of
the
superintendent
of
the
provincial
treasury
walked
in
at
the
door
ive
come
for
a
tiny
minute
a
tiny
minute
began
the
lady
sit
down
friend
and
listen
to
me
attentively
well
ive
been
told
you
have
a
post
vacant
today
or
tomorrow
you
will
receive
a
visit
from
a
young
man
called
polzuhin
the
lady
chattered
on
while
the
director
gazed
at
her
with
lustreless
stupefied
eyes
like
a
man
on
the
point
of
fainting
gazed
and
smiled
from
politeness
and
the
next
day
when
vremensky
came
to
his
office
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
director
could
bring
himself
to
tell
the
truth
he
hesitated
was
incoherent
and
could
not
think
how
to
begin
or
what
to
say
he
wanted
to
apologize
to
the
schoolmaster
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
but
his
tongue
halted
like
a
drunkards
his
ears
burned
and
he
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
vexation
and
resentment
that
he
should
have
to
play
such
an
absurd
partin
his
own
office
before
his
subordinate
he
suddenly
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
leaped
up
and
shouted
angrily
i
have
no
post
for
you
i
have
not
and
thats
all
about
it
leave
me
in
peace
dont
worry
me
be
so
good
as
to
leave
me
alone
and
he
walked
out
of
the
office
