but
you
know
she
took
drink
soon
she
got
money
she
was
off

not
content
with
port
or
anything
light
she
must
strong
brandy
fiery
stuff
stupefy

only
managed
get
through
five
hundred
where
did
you
put
money
its
ancient
history
theres
reason
conceal
it
now
my
pocket
course
why
you
look
me
like
that
wait
bit
what
will
come
later
its
regular
novel
pathological
study

drunken
condition
i
lighted

i
didnt
know
my

considering
that
she
wrote

herself
when
she
was
lying
hospital
afterwards
yes
but
i
was
so
taken
then
with
my
second
marriage
i
was
such
whirl
that
i
thoughts
spare
letters
but
you
were
an
outsider
you
antipathy
sofya
why
didnt
you
give
helping
hand
you
cant
judge
by
standards
day
boris
petrovitch
thats
how
look
it
now
but
time

very
differently

give
thousand
roubles
but
then
even
that
ten
rouble
note
i
did
not
give
nothing
it
was
bad
business
must
forget
it
but
here
sledge
stopped
cemetery
gates
uzelkov
shapkin
got
out
sledge
went
gate
walked
long
broad
avenue
bare
cherry
trees
acacias
grey
crosses
tombstones
were
silvered
with
hoar
frost
every
little
grain
snow
reflected
bright
sunny
day
there
was
smell
there
always
cemeteries
smell
incense
freshly
dug
earth
our
cemetery
pretty
one
said
uzelkov
quite
garden

but
it
pity
thieves
steal
tombstones
over
there
beyond
that
iron
monument

you
like
see
friends
turned
right
walked
through
deep
snow
iron
monument

said
shapkin
pointing

marble
lieutenant
put
stone
grave
uzelkov
slowly
took
off
cap
exposed
bald
head
sun
shapkin
looking
him
took
off
cap
too
another
bald
patch
gleamed
sunlight
there
was
stillness
tomb
around
though
air
too
were
dead
friends
looked
grave
pondered
said
nothing
she
sleeps
peace
said
shapkin
breaking
silence
its
nothing
now
that
she
took
blame
herself
drank
brandy
you
must
own
boris
petrovitch
own
what
uzelkov
asked
gloomily
why
however
hateful
past
it
was
better
than
this
shapkin
pointed
grey
head
i
used
not
think
hour
death
i
fancied
i
could
given
death
points
won
game
if
an
encounter
but
now
but
whats
good
talking
uzelkov
was
overcome
with
melancholy
he
suddenly
passionate
longing
weep
he
longed
love
he
felt
those
tears
would
tasted
sweet
refreshing
moisture
came
into
eyes
there
was
lump
throat
but
shapkin
was
standing
beside
him
uzelkov
was
ashamed
show
weakness
before
witness
he
turned
back
abruptly
went
into
church
only
two
hours
later
after
talking
churchwarden
looking
over
church
he
seized
moment
when
shapkin
was
conversation
with
priest
hastened
away
weep
he
stole
grave
secretly
furtively
looking
round
him
every
minute
little
white
slab
looked
him
pensively
mournfully
innocently
though
little
girl
lay
under
it
instead
dissolute
divorced
wife
weep
weep
thought
uzelkov
but
moment
tears
been
missed
though
old
man
balinked
eyes
though
he
worked
feelings
tears
did
not
flow
nor
lump
come
throat
after
standing
ten
minutes
with
gesture
despair
uzelkov
went
look
shapkin
