drunk
a
manufacturer
called
frolov
a
handsome
dark
man
with
a
round
beard
and
a
soft
velvety
expression
in
his
eyes
and
almer
his
lawyer
an
elderly
man
with
a
big
rough
head
were
drinking
in
one
of
the
public
rooms
of
a
restaurant
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
they
had
both
come
to
the
restaurant
straight
from
a
ball
and
so
were
wearing
dress
coats
and
white
ties
except
them
and
the
waiters
at
the
door
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
room
by
frolovs
orders
no
one
else
was
admitted
they
began
by
drinking
a
big
wine
glass
of
vodka
and
eating
oysters
good
said
almer
it
was
i
brought
oysters
into
fashion
for
the
first
course
my
boy
the
vodka
burns
and
stings
your
throat
and
you
have
a
voluptuous
sensation
in
your
throat
when
you
swallow
an
oyster
dont
you
a
dignified
waiter
with
a
shaven
upper
lip
and
grey
whiskers
put
a
sauceboat
on
the
table
whats
that
you
are
serving
asked
frolov
sauce
provenale
for
the
herring
sir
what
is
that
the
way
to
serve
it
shouted
frolov
not
looking
into
the
sauceboat
do
you
call
that
sauce
you
dont
know
how
to
wait
you
blockhead
frolovs
velvety
eyes
flashed
he
twisted
a
corner
of
the
table
cloth
round
his
finger
made
a
slight
movement
and
the
dishes
the
candlesticks
and
the
bottles
all
jingling
and
clattering
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
the
waiters
long
accustomed
to
pot
house
catastrophes
ran
up
to
the
table
and
began
picking
up
the
fragments
with
grave
and
unconcerned
faces
like
surgeons
at
an
operation
how
well
you
know
how
to
manage
them
said
almer
and
he
laughed
but
move
a
little
away
from
the
table
or
you
will
step
in
the
caviare
call
the
engineer
here
cried
frolov
this
was
the
name
given
to
a
decrepit
doleful
old
man
who
really
had
once
been
an
engineer
and
very
well
off
he
had
squandered
all
his
property
and
towards
the
end
of
his
life
had
got
into
a
restaurant
where
he
looked
after
the
waiters
and
singers
and
carried
out
various
commissions
relating
to
the
fair
sex
appearing
at
the
summons
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
respectfully
listen
my
good
man
frolov
said
addressing
him
whats
the
meaning
of
this
disorder
how
queerly
you
fellows
wait
dont
you
know
that
i
dont
like
it
devil
take
you
i
shall
give
up
coming
to
you
i
beg
you
graciously
to
excuse
it
alexey
semyonitch
said
the
engineer
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
will
take
steps
immediately
and
your
slightest
wishes
shall
be
carried
out
in
the
best
and
speediest
way
well
thatll
do
you
can
go
the
engineer
bowed
staggered
back
still
doubled
up
and
disappeared
through
the
doorway
with
a
final
flash
of
the
false
diamonds
on
his
shirt
front
and
fingers
the
table
was
laid
again
almer
drank
red
wine
and
ate
with
relish
some
sort
of
bird
served
with
truffles
and
ordered
a
matelote
of
eelpouts
and
a
sterlet
with
its
tail
in
its
mouth
frolov
only
drank
vodka
and
ate
nothing
but
bread
he
rubbed
his
face
with
his
open
hands
scowled
and
was
evidently
out
of
humour
both
were
silent
there
was
a
stillness
two
electric
lights
in
opaque
shades
flickered
and
hissed
as
though
they
were
angry
the
gypsy
girls
passed
the
door
softly
humming
one
drinks
and
is
none
the
merrier
said
frolov
the
more
i
pour
into
myself
the
more
sober
i
become
other
people
grow
festive
with
vodka
but
i
suffer
from
anger
disgusting
thoughts
sleeplessness
why
is
it
old
man
that
people
dont
invent
some
other
pleasure
besides
drunkenness
and
debauchery
its
really
horrible
you
had
better
send
for
the
gypsy
girls
confound
them
the
head
of
an
old
gypsy
woman
appeared
in
the
door
from
the
passage
alexey
semyonitch
the
gypsies
are
asking
for
tea
and
brandy
said
the
old
woman
may
we
order
it
yes
answered
frolov
you
know
they
get
a
percentage
from
the
restaurant
keeper
for
asking
the
visitors
to
treat
them
nowadays
you
cant
even
believe
a
man
when
he
asks
for
vodka
the
people
are
all
mean
vile
spoilt
take
these
waiters
for
instance
they
have
countenances
like
professors
and
grey
heads
they
get
two
hundred
roubles
a
month
they
live
in
houses
of
their
own
and
send
their
girls
to
the
high
school
but
you
may
swear
at
them
and
give
yourself
airs
as
much
as
you
please
for
a
rouble
the
engineer
will
gulp
down
a
whole
pot
of
mustard
and
crow
like
a
cock
on
my
honour
if
one
of
them
would
take
offence
i
would
make
him
a
present
of
a
thousand
roubles
whats
the
matter
with
you
said
almer
looking
at
him
with
surprise
whence
this
melancholy
you
are
red
in
the
face
you
look
like
a
wild
animal
whats
the
matter
with
you
its
horrid
theres
one
thing
i
cant
get
out
of
my
head
it
seems
as
though
it
is
nailed
there
and
it
wont
come
out
a
round
little
old
man
buried
in
fat
and
completely
bald
wearing
a
short
reefer
jacket
and
lilac
waistcoat
and
carrying
a
guitar
walked
into
the
room
he
made
an
idiotic
face
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
like
a
soldier
ah
the
parasite
said
frolov
let
me
introduce
him
he
has
made
his
fortune
by
grunting
like
a
pig
come
here
he
poured
vodka
wine
and
brandy
into
a
glass
sprinkled
pepper
and
salt
into
it
mixed
it
all
up
and
gave
it
to
the
parasite
the
latter
tossed
it
off
and
smacked
his
lips
with
gusto
hes
accustomed
to
drink
a
mess
so
that
pure
wine
makes
him
sick
said
frolov
come
parasite
sit
down
and
sing
the
old
man
sat
down
touched
the
strings
with
his
fat
fingers
and
began
singing
neetka
neetka
margareetka
after
drinking
champagne
frolov
was
drunk
he
thumped
with
his
fist
on
the
table
and
said
yes
theres
something
that
sticks
in
my
head
it
wont
give
me
a
minutes
peace
why
what
is
it
i
cant
tell
you
its
a
secret
its
something
so
private
that
i
could
only
speak
of
it
in
my
prayers
but
if
you
like
as
a
sign
of
friendship
between
ourselves
only
mind
to
no
one
no
no
no
ill
tell
you
it
will
ease
my
heart
but
for
gods
sake
listen
and
forget
it
frolov
bent
down
to
almer
and
for
a
minute
breathed
in
his
ear
i
hate
my
wife
he
brought
out
the
lawyer
looked
at
him
with
surprise
yes
yes
my
wife
marya
mihalovna
frolov
muttered
flushing
red
i
hate
her
and
thats
all
about
it
what
for
i
dont
know
myself
ive
only
been
married
two
years
i
married
as
you
know
for
love
and
now
i
hate
her
like
a
mortal
enemy
like
this
parasite
here
saving
your
presence
and
there
is
no
cause
no
sort
of
cause
when
she
sits
by
me
eats
or
says
anything
my
whole
soul
boils
i
can
scarcely
restrain
myself
from
being
rude
to
her
its
something
one
cant
describe
to
leave
her
or
tell
her
the
truth
is
utterly
impossible
because
it
would
be
a
scandal
and
living
with
her
is
worse
than
hell
for
me
i
cant
stay
at
home
i
spend
my
days
at
business
and
in
the
restaurants
and
spend
my
nights
in
dissipation
come
how
is
one
to
explain
this
hatred
she
is
not
an
ordinary
woman
but
handsome
clever
quiet
the
old
man
stamped
his
foot
and
began
singing
i
went
a
walk
with
a
captain
bold
and
in
his
ear
my
secrets
told
i
must
own
i
always
thought
that
marya
mihalovna
was
not
at
all
the
right
person
for
you
said
almer
after
a
brief
silence
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
do
you
mean
she
is
too
well
educated
i
took
the
gold
medal
at
the
commercial
school
myself
i
have
been
to
paris
three
times
i
am
not
cleverer
than
you
of
course
but
i
am
no
more
foolish
than
my
wife
no
brother
education
is
not
the
sore
point
let
me
tell
you
how
all
the
trouble
began
it
began
with
my
suddenly
fancying
that
she
had
married
me
not
from
love
but
for
the
sake
of
my
money
this
idea
took
possession
of
my
brain
i
have
done
all
i
could
think
of
but
the
cursed
thing
sticks
and
to
make
it
worse
my
wife
was
overtaken
with
a
passion
for
luxury
getting
into
a
sack
of
gold
after
poverty
she
took
to
flinging
it
in
all
directions
she
went
quite
off
her
head
and
was
so
carried
away
that
she
used
to
get
through
twenty
thousand
every
month
and
i
am
a
distrustful
man
i
dont
believe
in
anyone
i
suspect
everybody
and
the
more
friendly
you
are
to
me
the
greater
my
torment
i
keep
fancying
i
am
being
flattered
for
my
money
i
trust
no
one
i
am
a
difficult
man
my
boy
very
difficult
frolov
emptied
his
glass
at
one
gulp
and
went
on
but
thats
all
nonsense
he
said
one
never
ought
to
speak
of
it
its
stupid
i
am
tipsy
and
i
have
been
chattering
and
now
you
are
looking
at
me
with
lawyers
eyesglad
you
know
some
one
elses
secret
well
well
let
us
drop
this
conversation
let
us
drink
i
say
he
said
addressing
a
waiter
is
mustafa
here
fetch
him
in
shortly
afterwards
there
walked
into
the
room
a
little
tatar
boy
aged
about
twelve
wearing
a
dress
coat
and
white
gloves
come
here
frolov
said
to
him
explain
to
us
the
following
fact
there
was
a
time
when
you
tatars
conquered
us
and
took
tribute
from
us
but
now
you
serve
us
as
waiters
and
sell
dressing
gowns
how
do
you
explain
such
a
change
mustafa
raised
his
eyebrows
and
said
in
a
shrill
voice
with
a
sing
song
intonation
the
mutability
of
destiny
almer
looked
at
his
grave
face
and
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
well
give
him
a
rouble
said
frolov
he
is
making
his
fortune
out
of
the
mutability
of
destiny
he
is
only
kept
here
for
the
sake
of
those
two
words
drink
mustafa
you
will
make
a
gre
eat
rascal
i
mean
it
is
awful
how
many
of
your
sort
are
toadies
hanging
about
rich
men
the
number
of
these
peaceful
bandits
and
robbers
is
beyond
all
reckoning
shouldnt
we
send
for
the
gypsies
now
eh
fetch
the
gypsies
along
the
gypsies
who
had
been
hanging
about
wearily
in
the
corridors
for
a
long
time
burst
with
whoops
into
the
room
and
a
wild
orgy
began
drink
frolov
shouted
to
them
drink
seed
of
pharaoh
sing
a
a
ah
in
the
winter
time
o
o
ho
the
sledge
was
flying
the
gypsies
sang
whistled
danced
in
the
frenzy
which
sometimes
takes
possession
of
spoilt
and
very
wealthy
men
broad
natures
frolov
began
to
play
the
fool
he
ordered
supper
and
champagne
for
the
gypsies
broke
the
shade
of
the
electric
light
shied
bottles
at
the
pictures
and
looking
glasses
and
did
it
all
apparently
without
the
slightest
enjoyment
scowling
and
shouting
irritably
with
contempt
for
the
people
with
an
expression
of
hatred
in
his
eyes
and
his
manners
he
made
the
engineer
sing
a
solo
made
the
bass
singers
drink
a
mixture
of
wine
vodka
and
oil
at
six
oclock
they
handed
him
the
bill
nine
hundred
and
twenty
five
roubles
forty
kopecks
said
almer
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
whats
it
for

must
go
into
it

muttered
frolov
pulling
out
his
pocket
book

as
he
was
returning
home
with
almer
frolov
murmured

to
me

oh

why
at
the
entrance
to
his
house
he
craned
forward
towards
almer
and
staggering
kissed
him
on
the
lips
having
the
old
moscow
habit
of
kissing
indiscriminately
on
every
occasion
good

am
a
difficult
hateful
man
he

educated
clever
man
but

laugh
and
drink
with
me

help
from
any
of
you
but
if
you
were
a
friend
to
me
if

honest
man
in
reality
you

to
have
said
to
me

hateful
man

reptile
come

almer
muttered
go
to
bed
there

no
help
from

the
only
hope
is
that
when
i
am
in
the
country
in
the
summer
i
may
go
out
into
the
fields
and
a
storm
come
on
and
the
thunder
may
strike
me
dead
on
the
spot
good
bye
frolov
kissed
almer
once
more
and
muttering
and
dropping
asleep
as
he
walked
began
mounting
the
stairs
supported
by
two
footmen
