from
the
diary
of
a
violent
tempered
man
i
am
a
serious
person
and
my
mind
is
of
a
philosophic
bent
my
vocation
is
the
study
of
finance
i
am
a
student
of
financial
law
and
i
have
chosen
as
the
subject
of
my
dissertationthe
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
i
need
hardly
point
out
that
young
ladies
songs
moonlight
and
all
that
sort
of
silliness
are
entirely
out
of
my
line
morning
ten
oclock
my
maman
pours
me
out
a
cup
of
coffee
i
drink
it
and
go
out
on
the
little
balcony
to
set
to
work
on
my
dissertation
i
take
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
dip
the
pen
into
the
ink
and
write
out
the
title
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
after
thinking
a
little
i
write
historical
survey
we
may
deduce
from
some
allusions
in
herodotus
and
xenophon
that
the
origin
of
the
tax
on
dogs
goes
back
to
but
at
that
point
i
hear
footsteps
that
strike
me
as
highly
suspicious
i
look
down
from
the
balcony
and
see
below
a
young
lady
with
a
long
face
and
a
long
waist
her
name
i
believe
is
nadenka
or
varenka
it
really
does
not
matter
which
she
is
looking
for
something
pretends
not
to
have
noticed
me
and
is
humming
to
herself
dost
thou
remember
that
song
full
of
tenderness
i
read
through
what
i
have
written
and
want
to
continue
but
the
young
lady
pretends
to
have
just
caught
sight
of
me
and
says
in
a
mournful
voice
good
morning
nikolay
andreitch
only
fancy
what
a
misfortune
i
have
had
i
went
for
a
walk
yesterday
and
lost
the
little
ball
off
my
bracelet
i
read
through
once
more
the
opening
of
my
dissertation
i
trim
up
the
tail
of
the
letter
g
and
mean
to
go
on
but
the
young
lady
persists
nikolay
andreitch
she
says
wont
you
see
me
home
the
karelins
have
such
a
huge
dog
that
i
simply
darent
pass
it
alone
there
is
no
getting
out
of
it
i
lay
down
my
pen
and
go
down
to
her
nadenka
or
varenka
takes
my
arm
and
we
set
off
in
the
direction
of
her
villa
when
the
duty
of
walking
arm
in
arm
with
a
lady
falls
to
my
lot
for
some
reason
or
other
i
always
feel
like
a
peg
with
a
heavy
cloak
hanging
on
it
nadenka
or
varenka
between
ourselves
of
an
ardent
temperament
her
grandfather
was
an
armenian
has
a
peculiar
art
of
throwing
her
whole
weight
on
ones
arm
and
clinging
to
ones
side
like
a
leech
and
so
we
walk
along
as
we
pass
the
karelins
i
see
a
huge
dog
who
reminds
me
of
the
dog
licence
i
think
with
despair
of
the
work
i
have
begun
and
sigh
what
are
you
sighing
for
asks
nadenka
or
varenka
and
heaves
a
sigh
herself
here
i
must
digress
for
a
moment
to
explain
that
nadenka
or
varenka
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
believe
i
have
heard
her
called
mashenka
imagines
i
cant
guess
why
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
and
therefore
thinks
it
her
duty
as
a
humane
person
always
to
look
at
me
with
compassion
and
to
soothe
my
wound
with
words
listen
said
she
stopping
i
know
why
you
are
sighing
you
are
in
love
yes
but
i
beg
you
for
the
sake
of
our
friendship
to
believe
that
the
girl
you
love
has
the
deepest
respect
for
you
she
cannot
return
your
love
but
is
it
her
fault
that
her
heart
has
long
been
anothers
mashenkas
nose
begins
to
swell
and
turn
red
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
she
evidently
expects
some
answer
from
me
but
fortunately
at
this
moment
we
arrive
mashenkas
mamma
a
good
natured
woman
but
full
of
conventional
ideas
is
sitting
on
the
terrace
glancing
at
her
daughters
agitated
face
she
looks
intently
at
me
and
sighs
as
though
saying
to
herself
ah
these
young
people
they
dont
even
know
how
to
keep
their
secrets
to
themselves
on
the
terrace
with
her
are
several
young
ladies
of
various
colours
and
a
retired
officer
who
is
staying
in
the
villa
next
to
ours
he
was
wounded
during
the
last
war
in
the
left
temple
and
the
right
hip
this
unfortunate
man
is
like
myself
proposing
to
devote
the
summer
to
literary
work
he
is
writing
the
memoirs
of
a
military
man
like
me
he
begins
his
honourable
labours
every
morning
but
before
he
has
written
more
than
i
was
born
in
some
varenka
or
mashenka
is
sure
to
appear
under
his
balcony
and
the
wounded
hero
is
borne
off
under
guard
all
the
party
sitting
on
the
terrace
are
engaged
in
preparing
some
miserable
fruit
for
jam
i
make
my
bows
and
am
about
to
beat
a
retreat
but
the
young
ladies
of
various
colours
seize
my
hat
with
a
squeal
and
insist
on
my
staying
i
sit
down
they
give
me
a
plate
of
fruit
and
a
hairpin
i
begin
taking
the
seeds
out
the
young
ladies
of
various
colours
talk
about
men
they
say
that
so
and
so
is
nice
looking
that
so
and
so
is
handsome
but
not
nice
that
somebody
else
is
nice
but
ugly
and
that
a
fourth
would
not
have
been
bad
looking
if
his
nose
were
not
like
a
thimble
and
so
on
and
you
monsieur
nicolas
says
varenkas
mamma
turning
to
me
are
not
handsome
but
you
are
attractive
there
is
something
about
your
face
in
men
though
its
not
beauty
but
intelligence
that
matters
she
adds
sighing
the
young
ladies
sigh
too
and
drop
their
eyes
they
agree
that
the
great
thing
in
men
is
not
beauty
but
intelligence
i
steal
a
glance
sideways
at
a
looking
glass
to
ascertain
whether
i
really
am
attractive
i
see
a
shaggy
head
a
bushy
beard
moustaches
eyebrows
hair
on
my
cheeks
hair
up
to
my
eyes
a
perfect
thicket
with
a
solid
nose
sticking
up
out
of
it
like
a
watch
tower
attractive
hm
but
its
by
the
qualities
of
your
soul
after
all
that
you
will
make
your
way
nicolas
sighs
nadenkas
mamma
as
though
affirming
some
secret
and
original
idea
of
her
own
and
nadenka
is
sympathetically
distressed
on
my
account
but
the
conviction
that
a
man
passionately
in
love
with
her
is
sitting
opposite
is
obviously
a
source
of
the
greatest
enjoyment
to
her
when
they
have
done
with
men
the
young
ladies
begin
talking
about
love
after
a
long
conversation
about
love
one
of
the
young
ladies
gets
up
and
goes
away
those
that
remain
begin
to
pick
her
to
pieces
everyone
agrees
that
she
is
stupid
unbearable
ugly
and
that
one
of
her
shoulder
blades
sticks
out
in
a
shocking
way
but
at
last
thank
goodness
i
see
our
maid
my
maman
has
sent
her
to
call
me
in
to
dinner
now
i
can
make
my
escape
from
this
uncongenial
company
and
go
back
to
my
work
i
get
up
and
make
my
bows
varenkas
maman
varenka
herself
and
the
variegated
young
ladies
surround
me
and
declare
that
i
cannot
possibly
go
because
i
promised
yesterday
to
dine
with
them
and
go
to
the
woods
to
look
for
mushrooms
i
bow
and
sit
down
again
my
soul
is
boiling
with
rage
and
i
feel
that
in
another
moment
i
may
not
be
able
to
answer
for
myself
that
there
may
be
an
explosion
but
gentlemanly
feeling
and
the
fear
of
committing
a
breach
of
good
manners
compels
me
to
obey
the
ladies
and
i
obey
them
we
sit
down
to
dinner
the
wounded
officer
whose
wound
in
the
temple
has
affected
the
muscles
of
the
left
cheek
eats
as
though
he
had
a
bit
in
his
mouth
i
roll
up
little
balls
of
bread
think
about
the
dog
licence
and
knowing
the
ungovernable
violence
of
my
temper
try
to
avoid
speaking
nadenka
looks
at
me
sympathetically
soup
tongue
and
peas
roast
fowl
and
compte
i
have
no
appetite
but
eat
from
politeness
after
dinner
while
i
am
standing
alone
on
the
terrace
smoking
nadenkas
mamma
comes
up
to
me
presses
my
hand
and
says
breathlessly
dont
despair
nicolas
she
has
such
a
heart
such
a
heart
we
go
towards
the
wood
to
gather
mushrooms
varenka
hangs
on
my
arm
and
clings
to
my
side
my
sufferings
are
indescribable
but
i
bear
them
in
patience
we
enter
the
wood
listen
monsieur
nicolas
says
nadenka
sighing
why
are
you
so
melancholy
and
why
are
you
so
silent
extraordinary
girl
she
is
really
what
can
i
talk
to
her
about
what
have
we
in
common
oh
do
say
something
she
begs
me
i
begin
trying
to
think
of
something
popular
something
within
the
range
of
her
understanding
after
a
moments
thought
i
say
the
cutting
down
of
forests
has
been
greatly
detrimental
to
the
prosperity
of
russia
nicolas
sighs
nadenka
and
her
nose
begins
to
turn
red
nicolas
i
see
you
are
trying
to
avoid
being
open
with
me
you
seem
to
wish
to
punish
me
by
your
silence
your
feeling
is
not
returned
and
you
wish
to
suffer
in
silence
in
solitude
it
is
too
awful
nicolas
she
cries
impulsively
seizing
my
hand
and
i
see
her
nose
beginning
to
swell
what
would
you
say
if
the
girl
you
love
were
to
offer
you
her
eternal
friendship
i
mutter
something
incoherent
for
i
really
cant
think
what
to
say
to
her
in
the
first
place
im
not
in
love
with
any
girl
at
all
in
the
second
what
could
i
possibly
want
her
eternal
friendship
for
and
thirdly
i
have
a
violent
temper
mashenka
or
varenka
hides
her
face
in
her
hands
and
murmurs
as
though
to
herself
he
will
not
speak
it
is
clear
that
he
will
have
me
make
the
sacrifice
i
cannot
love
him
if
my
heart
is
still
anothers
but
i
will
think
of
it
very
good
i
will
think
of
it
i
will
prove
the
strength
of
my
soul
and
perhaps
at
the
cost
of
my
own
happiness
i
will
save
this
man
from
suffering
i
can
make
nothing
out
of
all
this
it
seems
some
special
sort
of
puzzle
we
go
farther
into
the
wood
and
begin
picking
mushrooms
we
are
perfectly
silent
the
whole
time
nadenkas
face
shows
signs
of
inward
struggle
i
hear
the
bark
of
dogs
it
reminds
me
of
my
dissertation
and
i
sigh
heavily
between
the
trees
i
catch
sight
of
the
wounded
officer
limping
painfully
along
the
poor
fellows
right
leg
is
lame
from
his
wound
and
on
his
left
arm
he
has
one
of
the
variegated
young
ladies
his
face
expresses
resignation
to
destiny
we
go
back
to
the
house
to
drink
tea
after
which
we
play
croquet
and
listen
to
one
of
the
variegated
young
ladies
singing
a
song
no
no
thou
lovest
not
no
no
at
the
word
no
she
twists
her
mouth
till
it
almost
touches
one
ear
charmant
wail
the
other
young
ladies
charmant
the
evening
comes
on
a
detestable
moon
creeps
up
behind
the
bushes
there
is
perfect
stillness
in
the
air
and
an
unpleasant
smell
of
freshly
cut
hay
i
take
up
my
hat
and
try
to
get
away
i
have
something
i
must
say
to
you
mashenka
whispers
to
me
significantly
dont
go
away
i
have
a
foreboding
of
evil
but
politeness
obliges
me
to
remain
mashenka
takes
my
arm
and
leads
me
away
to
a
garden
walk
by
this
time
her
whole
figure
expresses
conflict
she
is
pale
and
gasping
for
breath
and
she
seems
absolutely
set
on
pulling
my
right
arm
out
of
the
socket
what
can
be
the
matter
with
her
listen
she
mutters
no
i
cannot
no
she
tries
to
say
something
but
hesitates
now
i
see
from
her
face
that
she
has
come
to
some
decision
with
gleaming
eyes
and
swollen
nose
she
snatches
my
hand
and
says
hurriedly
nicolas
i
am
yours
love
you
i
cannot
but
i
promise
to
be
true
to
you
then
she
squeezes
herself
to
my
breast
and
at
once
springs
away
someone
is
coming
she
whispers
farewell
to
morrow
at
eleven
oclock
i
will
be
in
the
arbour
farewell
and
she
vanishes
completely
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
of
her
conduct
and
suffering
from
a
painful
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
make
my
way
home
there
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
is
awaiting
me
but
i
am
quite
unable
to
work
i
am
furious
i
may
say
my
anger
is
terrible
damn
it
all
i
allow
no
one
to
treat
me
like
a
boy
i
am
a
man
of
violent
temper
and
it
is
not
safe
to
trifle
with
me
when
the
maid
comes
in
to
call
me
to
supper
i
shout
to
her
go
out
of
the
room
such
hastiness
augurs
nothing
good
next
morning
typical
holiday
weather
temperature
below
freezing
a
cutting
wind
rain
mud
and
a
smell
of
naphthaline
because
my
maman
has
taken
all
her
wraps
out
of
her
trunks
a
devilish
morning
it
is
the
th
of
august
the
date
of
the
solar
eclipse
i
may
here
remark
that
at
the
time
of
an
eclipse
every
one
of
us
may
without
special
astronomical
knowledge
be
of
the
greatest
service
thus
for
example
anyone
of
us
can
take
the
measurement
of
the
diameters
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
sketch
the
corona
of
the
sun
take
the
temperature
take
observations
of
plants
and
animals
during
the
eclipse
note
down
his
own
impressions
and
so
on
it
is
a
matter
of
such
exceptional
importance
that
i
lay
aside
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
and
make
up
my
mind
to
observe
the
eclipse
we
all
get
up
very
early
and
i
divide
the
work
as
follows
i
am
to
measure
the
diameter
of
the
sun
and
moon
the
wounded
officer
is
to
sketch
the
corona
and
the
other
observations
are
undertaken
by
mashenka
and
the
variegated
young
ladies
we
all
meet
together
and
wait
what
is
the
cause
of
the
eclipse
asks
mashenka
i
reply
a
solar
eclipse
occurs
when
the
moon
moving
in
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
crosses
the
line
joining
the
centres
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
and
what
does
the
ecliptic
mean
i
explain
mashenka
listens
attentively
can
one
see
through
the
smoked
glass
the
line
joining
the
centres
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
she
enquires
i
reply
that
this
is
only
an
imaginary
line
drawn
theoretically
if
it
is
only
an
imaginary
line
how
can
the
moon
cross
it
varenka
says
wondering
i
make
no
reply
i
feel
my
spleen
rising
at
this
nave
question
its
all
nonsense
says
mashenkas
maman
impossible
to
tell
whats
going
to
happen
youve
never
been
in
the
sky
so
what
can
you
know
of
what
is
to
happen
with
the
sun
and
moon
its
all
fancy
at
that
moment
a
black
patch
begins
to
move
over
the
sun
general
confusion
follows
the
sheep
and
horses
and
cows
run
bellowing
about
the
fields
with
their
tails
in
the
air
the
dogs
howl
the
bugs
thinking
night
has
come
on
creep
out
of
the
cracks
in
the
walls
and
bite
the
people
who
are
still
in
bed
the
deacon
who
was
engaged
in
bringing
some
cucumbers
from
the
market
garden
jumped
out
of
his
cart
and
hid
under
the
bridge
while
his
horse
walked
off
into
somebody
elses
yard
where
the
pigs
ate
up
all
the
cucumbers
the
excise
officer
who
had
not
slept
at
home
that
night
but
at
a
lady
friends
dashed
out
with
nothing
on
but
his
nightshirt
and
running
into
the
crowd
shouted
frantically
save
yourself
if
you
can
numbers
of
the
lady
visitors
even
young
and
pretty
ones
run
out
of
their
villas
without
even
putting
their
slippers
on
scenes
occur
which
i
hesitate
to
describe
oh
how
dreadful
shriek
the
variegated
young
ladies
its
really
too
awful
mesdames
watch
i
cry
time
is
precious
and
i
hasten
to
measure
the
diameters
i
remember
the
corona
and
look
towards
the
wounded
officer
he
stands
doing
nothing
whats
the
matter
i
shout
how
about
the
corona
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
looks
helplessly
towards
his
arms
the
poor
fellow
has
variegated
young
ladies
on
both
sides
of
him
clinging
to
him
in
terror
and
preventing
him
from
working
i
seize
a
pencil
and
note
down
the
time
to
a
second
that
is
of
great
importance
i
note
down
the
geographical
position
of
the
point
of
observation
that
too
is
of
importance
i
am
just
about
to
measure
the
diameter
when
mashenka
seizes
my
hand
and
says
do
not
forget
to
day
eleven
oclock
i
withdraw
my
hand
feeling
every
second
precious
try
to
continue
my
observations
but
varenka
clutches
my
arm
and
clings
to
me
pencil
pieces
of
glass
drawingsall
are
scattered
on
the
grass
hang
it
its
high
time
the
girl
realized
that
i
am
a
man
of
violent
temper
and
when
i
am
roused
my
fury
knows
no
bounds
i
cannot
answer
for
myself
i
try
to
continue
but
the
eclipse
is
over
look
at
me
she
whispers
tenderly
oh
that
is
the
last
straw
trying
a
mans
patience
like
that
can
but
have
a
fatal
ending
i
am
not
to
blame
if
something
terrible
happens
i
allow
no
one
to
make
a
laughing
stock
of
me
and
god
knows
when
i
am
furious
i
advise
nobody
to
come
near
me
damn
it
all
theres
nothing
i
might
not
do
one
of
the
young
ladies
probably
noticing
from
my
face
what
a
rage
i
am
in
and
anxious
to
propitiate
me
says
i
did
exactly
what
you
told
me
nikolay
andreitch
i
watched
the
animals
i
saw
the
grey
dog
chasing
the
cat
just
before
the
eclipse
and
wagging
his
tail
for
a
long
while
afterwards
so
nothing
came
of
the
eclipse
after
all
i
go
home
thanks
to
the
rain
i
work
indoors
instead
of
on
the
balcony
the
wounded
officer
has
risked
it
and
has
again
got
as
far
as
i
was
born
in
when
i
see
one
of
the
variegated
young
ladies
pounce
down
on
him
and
bear
him
off
to
her
villa
i
cannot
work
for
i
am
still
in
a
fury
and
suffering
from
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
do
not
go
to
the
arbour
it
is
impolite
not
to
but
after
all
i
cant
be
expected
to
go
in
the
rain
at
twelve
oclock
i
receive
a
letter
from
mashenka
a
letter
full
of
reproaches
and
entreaties
to
go
to
the
arbour
addressing
me
as
thou
at
one
oclock
i
get
a
second
letter
and
at
two
a
third
i
must
go
but
before
going
i
must
consider
what
i
am
to
say
to
her
i
will
behave
like
a
gentleman
to
begin
with
i
will
tell
her
that
she
is
mistaken
in
supposing
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
thats
a
thing
one
does
not
say
to
a
lady
as
a
rule
though
to
tell
a
lady
that
ones
not
in
love
with
her
is
almost
as
rude
as
to
tell
an
author
he
cant
write
the
best
thing
will
be
to
explain
my
views
of
marriage
i
put
on
my
winter
overcoat
take
an
umbrella
and
walk
to
the
arbour
knowing
the
hastiness
of
my
temper
i
am
afraid
i
may
be
led
into
speaking
too
strongly
i
will
try
to
restrain
myself
i
find
nadenka
still
waiting
for
me
she
is
pale
and
in
tears
on
seeing
me
she
utters
a
cry
of
joy
flings
herself
on
my
neck
and
says
at
last
you
are
trying
my
patience
listen
i
have
not
slept
all
night
i
have
been
thinking
and
thinking
i
believe
that
when
i
come
to
know
you
better
i
shall
learn
to
love
you
i
sit
down
and
begin
to
unfold
my
views
of
marriage
to
begin
with
to
clear
the
ground
of
digressions
and
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
i
open
with
a
short
historical
survey
i
speak
of
marriage
in
ancient
egypt
and
india
then
pass
to
more
recent
times
a
few
ideas
from
schopenhauer
mashenka
listens
attentively
but
all
of
a
sudden
through
some
strange
incoherence
of
ideas
thinks
fit
to
interrupt
me
nicolas
kiss
me
she
says
i
am
embarrassed
and
dont
know
what
to
say
to
her
she
repeats
her
request
there
seems
no
avoiding
it
i
get
up
and
bend
over
her
long
face
feeling
as
i
do
so
just
as
i
did
in
my
childhood
when
i
was
lifted
up
to
kiss
my
grandmother
in
her
coffin
not
content
with
the
kiss
mashenka
leaps
up
and
impulsively
embraces
me
at
that
instant
mashenkas
maman
appears
in
the
doorway
of
the
arbour
she
makes
a
face
as
though
in
alarm
and
saying
sh
sh
to
someone
with
her
vanishes
like
mephistopheles
through
the
trapdoor
confused
and
enraged
i
return
to
our
villa
at
home
i
find
varenkas
maman
embracing
my
maman
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
my
maman
weeps
and
says
i
always
hoped
for
it
and
then
if
you
please
nadenkas
maman
comes
up
to
me
embraces
me
and
says
may
god
bless
you
mind
you
love
her
well
remember
the
sacrifice
she
is
making
for
your
sake
and
here
i
am
at
my
wedding
at
the
moment
i
write
these
last
words
my
best
man
is
at
my
side
urging
me
to
make
haste
these
people
have
no
idea
of
my
character
i
have
a
violent
temper
i
cannot
always
answer
for
myself
hang
it
all
god
knows
what
will
come
of
it
to
lead
a
violent
desperate
man
to
the
altar
is
as
unwise
as
to
thrust
ones
hand
into
the
cage
of
a
ferocious
tiger
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
and
so
i
am
married
everybody
congratulates
me
and
varenka
keeps
clinging
to
me
and
saying
now
you
are
mine
mine
do
you
understand
that
tell
me
that
you
love
me
and
her
nose
swells
as
she
says
it
i
learn
from
my
best
man
that
the
wounded
officer
has
very
cleverly
escaped
the
snares
of
hymen
he
showed
the
variegated
young
lady
a
medical
certificate
that
owing
to
the
wound
in
his
temple
he
was
at
times
mentally
deranged
and
incapable
of
contracting
a
valid
marriage
an
inspiration
i
might
have
got
a
certificate
too
an
uncle
of
mine
drank
himself
to
death
another
uncle
was
extremely
absent
minded
on
one
occasion
he
put
a
ladys
muff
on
his
head
in
mistake
for
his
hat
an
aunt
of
mine
played
a
great
deal
on
the
piano
and
used
to
put
out
her
tongue
at
gentlemen
she
did
not
like
and
my
ungovernable
temper
is
a
very
suspicious
symptom
but
why
do
these
great
ideas
always
come
too
late
why
