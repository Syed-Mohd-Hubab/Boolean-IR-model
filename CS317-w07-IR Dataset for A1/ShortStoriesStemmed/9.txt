fifth
centuri
just
as
now
the
sun
rose
everi
morn
and
everi
even
retir
to
rest
in
the
morn
when
the
first
ray

with
the
sound
of
raptur
and
hope
while
in

dark
one
day
was
like
anoth
one
night
like
anoth
from
time
to
time
a
storm
cloud
race
up
and
there
was
the
angri
rumbl
of
thunder
or
a
neglig
star
fell
out
of
the
sky
or
a
pale
monk
ran
to
tell
the
brotherhood
that
not
far
from
the
monasteri
he
had
seen
a
tigerand
that
was
all
and
then
each
day
was
like
the
next
the
monk
work
and
pray
and
their
father
superior
play
on
the
organ
made
latin
vers
and
wrote
music
the
wonder
old
man
possess
an
extraordinari
gift
he
play
on
the
organ
with
such
art
that
even
the
oldest
monk
whose
hear
had
grown
somewhat
dull
toward
the
end
of
their
live
could
not
restrain
their
tear
when
the
sound
of
the
organ
float
from
his
cell
when
he
spoke
of
anyth
even
of
the
most
ordinari
thingsfor
instanc
of
the
tree
of
the
wild
beast
or
of
the
seathey
could
not
listen
to
him
without
a
smile
or
tear
and
it
seem
that
the
same
chord
vibrat
in
his
soul
as
in
the
organ
if
he
were
move
to
anger
or
abandon
himself
to
intens
joy
or
began
speak
of
someth
terribl
or
grand
then
a
passion
inspir
took
possess
of
him
tear
came
into
his
flash
eye
his
face
flush
and
his
voic
thunder
and
as
the
monk
listen
to
him
they
felt
that
their
soul
were
spell
bound
by
his
inspir
at
such
marvel
splendid
moment
his
power
over
them
was
boundless
and
if
he
had
bidden
his
elder
fling
themselv
into
the
sea
they
would
all
everi
one
of
them
have
hasten
to
carri
out
his
wish
his
music
his
voic
his
poetri
in
which
he
glorifi

and
the
earth
were
a
continu
sourc
of
joy
to
the
monk

happen
that
through
the
monotoni
of
their
live
they
grew
weari
of
the
tree

autumn
their
ear
were
tire
of
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
the
song
of
the
bird
seem
tedious
to
them
but
the
talent
of
their
father
superior
were
as
necessari
to
them
as
their
daili
bread
dozen
of
year

by
and
everi
day
was
like
everi
