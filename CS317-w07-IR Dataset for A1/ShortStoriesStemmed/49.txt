some
prefer
the

one
can
drive
round
the
whole

your
franc
in
one
day
while
here
when
you
drive
out
of
the

can
see
no
end
to
the
land

can
ride
on

no
better
peopl
than
the
french
well
educ
clever
peopl
civil
i
agre
the
french
are
all
well
educ
with
eleg
manner
that
is
true
a
frenchman
never
allow
himself
to
be
rude
he
hand
a
ladi
a
chair
at
the
right
minut
he
doesnt
eat
crayfish
with
his
fork
he
doesnt
spit
on
the
floor

there
not
the
same
spirit
in
him
not
the

i
dont

to
explain
it
to
you

howev
one
is
to
