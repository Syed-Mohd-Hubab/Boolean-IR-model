that

it
was
remark
that
whatev
he
said
his
word
sound
stilt
soulless
and
inappropri
floweri
and
even
seem
an
outrag
on
the
atmospher
of
the
doctor
home
and
on
the
woman
who
was
somewher
die
he
felt
this
himself
and
so
afraid
of
not
be
understood
did
his
utmost
to
put
soft
and
tender
into
his
voic
so
that
the
sincer
of
his

might
prevail
if
his
