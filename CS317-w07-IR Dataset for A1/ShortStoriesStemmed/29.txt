and
navagin
began
examin
fedyukov
signatur
the
bold
florid
signatur
in
the

style
with
twirl
and
flourish
was
utter
unlik
the

it
was
next
below
the
signatur
of
shtutchkin
the
provinci
secretari
a

timor
littl
man
who

an
impud
joke
the
mysteri
fedyukov
has
sign

again
said
navagin
go
in
to
see
his

again
i
fail
to
find

is
madam
navagin
was
a
spiritualist
and
so
for
all
phenomena
in
natur
comprehens
or
incomprehens
she
had
a
veri
simpl
explan
there
noth
extraordinari
about
it
she
said
you
dont
believ
it
of
cours
but
i
have
said
it
alreadi
and
i
say
it
again
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
world
that
is
supernatur
which
our
feebl
intellect
can
never
grasp
i
am
convinc
that
this
fedyukov
is
a
spirit
who
has
a
sympathi
for
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
call
him
up
and
ask
him
what
he
want
nonsens
nonsens
navagin
was
free
from
superstit
but
the
phenomenon
which
interest
him
was
so
mysteri
that
all
sort
of
uncanni
devilri
intrud
into
his
mind
against
his
will
all
the
even
he
was
imagin
that
the
incognito
fedyukov
was
the
spirit
of
some
long
dead
clerk
who
had
been
discharg
from
the
servic
by
navagin
ancestor
and
was
now
reveng
himself
on
their
descend
or
perhap
it
was
the
kinsman
of
some
petti
offici
dismiss
by
navagin
himself
or
of
a

of
the
brain
for
a
fortnight
he
was
silent
