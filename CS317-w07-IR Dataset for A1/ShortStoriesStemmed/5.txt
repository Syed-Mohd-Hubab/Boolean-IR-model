practic
man
and
a
man
of
charact
for
me
beauti
and
extern
appear
general
take
a
secondari
place
for
as
you
know
yourself
beauti
is
neither
bowl
nor
platter
and
a
pretti
wife
involv
a
great
deal
of
anxieti
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
what
matter
most
in
a
woman
is
not
what
is
extern
but
what
lie
withinthat
is
that
she
should
have
soul
and
all
the
qualiti
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
of
cours
it
would
be
veri
agreeabl
that
one
wife
should
be
rather
plump
but
for
mutual
happi
it
is
not
of
great
consequ
what
matter
is
the
mind
proper
speak
a
woman
doe
not
need
mind
either
for
if
she
has
brain
she
will
have
too
high
an
opinion
of
herself
and
take
all
sort
of
idea
into
her
head
one
cannot
do
without
educ
nowaday
of
cours
but
educ
is
of
differ
kind
it
would
be
pleas
for
one
wife
to
know
french
and
german
to
speak
various
languag
veri
pleas
but
what
the
use
of
that
if
she
cant
sew
on
one
button
perhap
i
am
a
man
of
the
educ
class
