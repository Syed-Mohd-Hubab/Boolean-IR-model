and
in
the
distanc
there
were
bluish
patch
of
young
cops
yergunov
began
think
how
he
would
be
greet
at

hospit
and
what
the
doctor
would
say
to
him
it
was
absolut
necessari
to
think
of
that
and
to
prepar
beforehand
to
answer
question
he
would
be
ask
but
this
thought
grew
blur
and
slip
away
he
walk
along
think
of
noth
but
lyubka
of
the
peasant
with
whom
he
had
pass
the
night
he
rememb
how
after
lyubka
struck
him
the
second
time
she
had
bent
down
to
the
floor
for
the
quilt
and
how
her
loos
hair
had
fallen
on
the
floor
his
mind
was
in
a
maze
and
he
wonder
whi
there
were
in
the
world
doctor
hospit
assist
merchant
clerk
and
peasant
instead
of
simpl
free
men
there
are
to
be
sure
free
bird
free
beast
a
free
merik
and
they
are
not
afraid
of
anyon
and
dont
need
anyon
and
whose
idea
was
it
who
had
decre
that
one
must
get
up
in
the
morn
dine
at
midday
go
to
bed
in
the
even
that
a
doctor
take
preced
of
a
hospit
assist
that
one
must
live
in
room
and
love
onli
one
wife
and
whi
not
the
contrarydin
at
night
and
sleep
in
the
day
ah
to
jump
on
a
hors
without
enquir
whose
it
is
to
ride
race
with
the
wind
like
a
devil
over
field
and
forest
and
ravin
to
make
love
to
girl
to
mock
at
everyon
yergunov
thrust
the
poker
into
the
snow
press
his
forehead
to
the
cold
white
trunk
of
a
birch
tree
and
sank
into
thought
and
his
grey
monoton
life
his
wage
his
subordin
posit
the
dispensari
the
everlast
to
do
with
the
bottl
and
blister
struck
him
as
contempt
sicken
who
say
it
a
sin
to
enjoy
oneself
he
ask
himself
with
vexat
those
who
say
that
have
never
live
in
freedom
like
merik
and
kalashnikov
and
have
never
love
lyubka

have
been
beggar
all
their
live
have
live
without
ani
pleasur
and
have
onli
love
their
wive
who
are
like

and
he
thought
about
himself
that
he
had
not
hitherto
been
a
thief
a
swindler
or
even
a
brigand
simpli
becaus
he
could
