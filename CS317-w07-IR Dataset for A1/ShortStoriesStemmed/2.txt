now
this

made
a
peculiar
strang

whatev

fanci
everi

start
at

smile
and
began
whistl
so
as
to
seem
unconcern
he
could
not
sleep
for
whole
night
in
success
expect
to
be
arrest
but
he
snore
loud
and
sigh
as
though
in
deep
sleep
that
his
landladi
might
think
he
was
asleep
for
if
he
could
not
sleep
it
meant
that
he
was
torment
by
the
sting
of
consciencewhat
a
piec
of
evid
fact
and
common
sens
persuad
him
that
all
these

were
nonsens
and
morbid
that
if

look
at
the
matter
more
broad
there
was
noth
realli
terribl
in

long
as
the

is
at

but
the
more
sensibl
and
logic
he
reason
the
more
acut
and
agon
his
mental
distress
becam
it
might
be
compar
with
the
stori
of

who
tri
to

place
for

in

the
more

he
work
with

the
thicker
the

grew
in
the
end
ivan
dmitritch
see
it
was
useless
gave
up
reason
altogeth
and
abandon
himself
entir
to
despair
and
terror
he
began
to
avoid
peopl

to
seek
solitud
his

work
had
been
distast
to
him
befor
now
it
becam
unbear
to
him
he
was
afraid
they
would
somehow
get
him
into
troubl
would
put
a
bribe
in

unnot

then
denounc
him

that
he
would
accident
make
a
mistak
in

that
would
appear
to
be

would
lose

it
is
strang
that
his

had
never
at

been
so
agil
and
invent
as
now
when
everi

he
thought
of
thousand
of

anxious
over

but
on
the
other
hand
his
interest
in
the
outer

in

in

grew
sensibl
fainter
and
his

began
to
fail
him
in

of

defenceless
but
this
duplic
soon
exhaust
him
and
after

reflect
he
decid
that
in

to

was

a
rather
strang
rumour
has
howev
been
circul
in
the
hospit
of
late
it
is
rumour
that
the
doctor
has
begun
to
visit
ward
no
v
a
strang
rumour
dr
andrey
yefimitch
ragin
is
a
strang
man
in
his
way
they
say
that
when
he
was
young
he
was
veri
religi
and
prepar
himself
for
a
cleric
career
and
that
when
he
had
finish
his
studi
at
the
high
school
in
he
intend
to
enter
a
theolog
academi
but
that
his
father
a
surgeon
and
doctor
of
medicin
jeer
at
him
and
declar
point
blank
that
he
would
disown
him
if
he
becam
a
priest
how
far
this
is
true
i
dont
know
but
andrey
yefimitch
himself
has
more
than
onc
confess
that
he
has
never
had
a
natur
bent
for
medicin
or
scienc
in
general
howev
that
may
have
been
when
he
finish
his
studi
in
the
medic
faculti
he
did
not
enter
the
priesthood
he
show
no
special
devout
and
was
no
more
like
a
priest
at
the
begin
of
his
medic
career
than
he
is
now
his
exterior
is
heavycoars
like
a
peasant
his
face
his
beard
his
flat
hair
and
his
coars
clumsi
figur
suggest
an
overf
intemper
and
harsh
innkeep
on
the
highroad
his
face
is
sur
look
and
cover
with
blue
vein
his
eye
are
littl
and
his
nose
is
red
with
his
height
and
broad
shoulder
he
has
huge
hand
and
feet
one
would
think
that
a
blow
from
his
fist
would
knock
the
life
out
of
anyon
but
his
step
is
soft
and
his
walk
is
cautious
and
insinu
when
he
meet
anyon
in
a
narrow
passag
he
is
alway
the
first
to
stop
and
make
way
and
to
say
not
in
a
bass
as
one
would
expect
but
in
a
high
soft
tenor
i
beg
your
pardon
he
has
a
littl
swell
on
his
neck
which
prevent
him
from
wear
stiff
starch
collar
and
so
he
alway
goe
about
in
soft
linen
or
cotton
shirt
altogeth
he
doe
not
dress
like
a
doctor
he
wear
the
same
suit
for
ten
year
and
the
new
cloth
which
he
usual
buy
at
a
jewish
shop
look
as
shabbi
and
crumpl
on
him
as
his
old
one
he
see
patient
and
dine
and
pay
visit
all
in
the
same
coat
but
this
is
not
due
to
niggardli
but
to
complet
careless
about
his
appear
when
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
town
to
take
up
his
duti
the
institut
found
to
the
glori
of

was
in
a
terribl
condit
one
could
hard
breath
for
the
stench
in

in
the
passag
and
in
the
courtyard
of
the

the
hospit
servant
the
nurs
and
their
children
slept
in
the

togeth
with
the

they
complain
that
there
was
no

these
disord
proceed
were
perfect
well
known
in

and
were
even
exagger
but
peopl
took
them
calm
some
justifi

on
the
ground
that
there
were
onli
peasant
and
work
men
in

who
could
not

they
were

said
in

without

on
the
fact
that
the

alreadi
had
it
hospit
after
look
over
the
hospit
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
conclus
that
it
was
an
immor
institut
and
extrem
prejudici
to
the
health
of
the
townspeopl
in
his
opinion
the
most
sensibl
thing
that
could
be
done
was
to
let
out
the
patient
and
close
the
hospit
but
he
reflect
that
his
will
alon
was
not
enough
to
do
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
if
physic
and
moral
impur
were
driven
out
of

they
would
onli
move
to

one
must
wait
for
it
to
wither

of
itself
besid
if
peopl
open
a
hospit
and
put
up
with

it
it
must
be
becaus
they
need
it
superstit
and
all
the
nasti
and
abomin
of
daili

were
necessari
sinc
in
process
of
time
they
work
out
to
someth

just
as

there

about

he

he
was
absolut

brief
question
and
the
administr
of
some
drug
such
as
castor

andrey

would
sit
with

rest
in

lost
in

and
ask

sat
down
too
rub
his

from

put
in

we

never
perform

when

evil
in
extern
thingsthat
is
in

marcus
aurelius
say
a

is
a
vivid
idea
of
pain
make
an
effort
of
will
to
chang
that
idea
dismiss
it
ceas
to
complain
and
the

will
disappear
that
is
true
the
wise
man
or
simpli
the
reflect

man
is
distinguish
precis
by
his
contempt
for

he
is
alway

surpris
at

then
i
am
an
idiot
sinc
i
suffer
and
am
discont
and
surpris
at
the
base
of
mankind
you
are
wrong
in
that
if
you
will
reflect
more
on
the

you
will
understand
how
insignific
is
all
that
extern
world
that
agit
us

must
strive
for
the
comprehens
of
life
and
in
that
is
true
happi

repeat
ivan
dmitritch
frown
extern
intern
excus
me
but
i
dont
understand
it
i
onli
know
he
said
get
up
and
look
angrili
at
the
doctori
onli
know
that
god
has
creat
me
of
warm

and
nerv
yes
inde
if
organ
tissu
is
capabl
of

it
must
react

i
do
to
pain
i
respond
with
tear
and
outcri
to
base
with
indign
to
filth
with
loath
to
my
mind
that
is
just
what
is
call
life
the
lower
the
organ
the
less
sensit
it
is
and
the
more
feebli
it
react
to
stimulus
and
the
higher
it
is
the
more
respons
and
vigor
it
react
to
realiti
how
is
it
you
dont
know
that
a
doctor
and
not
know
such
trifl
to
despis
suffer
to
be
alway
content
and
to
be
surpris
at
noth
one
must
reach
this
conditionand
ivan
dmitritch
point
to
the
peasant
who
was
a
mass
of
fator
to
harden
oneself
by
suffer
to
such
a
point
that
one
lose
all
sensibl
to
itthat
is
in
other
word
to
ceas
to
live
you
must
excus
me
i
am
not
a
sage
or
a
philosoph
ivan
dmitritch
continu
with
irrit
and
i
dont
understand
anyth
about
it
i
am
not
capabl
of
reason
on
the
contrari
your
reason
is
excel
the
stoic
whom
you
are
parodi
were
remark
peopl
but
their
doctrin
crystal
two
thousand
year
ago
and
has
not
advanc
and
will
not
advanc
an
inch
forward
sinc
it
is
not
practic
or
live
it
had
a
success
onli
with
the
minor
which
spend
it
life
in
savour
all
sort
of
theori
and
rumin
over
them
the
major
did
not
understand
it
a
doctrin
which
advoc
indiffer
to
wealth
and
to
the
comfort
of
life
and
a
contempt
for
suffer
and
death
is
quit
unintellig
to
the
vast
major
of
men
sinc
that
major
has
never
known
wealth
or
the
comfort
of
life
and
to
despis
suffer
would
mean
to
it
despis
life
itself
sinc
the
whole
exist
of
man
is
made
up
of
the
sensat
of
hunger
cold
injuri
and
a
hamlet
like
dread
of
death
the
whole
of
life
lie
in
these
sensat
one
may
be
oppress
by
it
one
may
hate
it
but
one
cannot
despis
it
yes
so
i
repeat
the
doctrin
of
the
stoic
can
never
have
a
futur
from
the
begin
of
time
up
to
to
day
you
see
continu
increas
the
struggl
the
sensibl
to
pain
the
capac
of
respond
to
stimulus
ivan
dmitritch
sudden
lost
the
thread
of
his
thought
stop
and
rub
his
forehead
with
vexat
i
meant
to
say
someth
import
but
i
have
lost
it
he
said
what
was
i
say
oh
yes
this
is
what
i
mean
one
of
the
stoic
sold
himself
into
slaveri
to
redeem
his
neighbour
so
you
see
even
a
stoic
did
react
to
stimulus
sinc
for
such
a
generous
act
as
the
destruct
of
oneself
for
the
sake
of
one
neighbour
he
must
have
had
a
soul
capabl
of
piti
and
indign
here
in
prison
i
have
forgotten
everyth
i
have
learn
or
els
i
could
have
recal
someth
els
take
christ
for
instanc
christ
respond
to
realiti
by
weep
smile
be
sorrow
and
move
to
wrath
even
overcom
by
miseri
he
did
not
go
to
meet
his
suffer
with
a
smile
he
did
not
despis
death
but
pray
in
the
garden
of
gethseman
that
this
cup
might
pass
him
by
ivan
dmitritch
laugh
and
sat
down
grant
that
a
man
peac
and
content
lie
not
outsid
but
in
himself
he
said
grant
that
one
must
despis
suffer
and
not
be
surpris
at
anyth
yet
on
what
ground
do
you
preach
the
theori
are
you
a
sage
a
philosoph
no
i
am
not
a
philosoph
but
everyon
ought
to
preach
it
becaus
it
is
reason
no
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
consid
yourself
compet
to
judg
of
comprehens
contempt
for
suffer
and
so
on
have
you
ever
suffer
have
you
ani
idea
of
suffer
allow
me
to
ask
you
were
you
ever

in
your
childhood
no
my
parent

cruelli
my
father
was
a
harsh
sick
govern
clerk
with

but
let
us
talk
of
you
no
one
has
laid
a
finger
on
you
all
your
life
no
one
has
scare
you
nor

you
you
are
as
strong
as

you
grew
up
under
your

and
then
you
drop
at

all

the
right
to

how
you
pleas
and
as
much
as
you
pleas
even
to
do
noth
you
were
natur
a
flabbi
lazi
man
and
so
you
have
tri
to
arrang
your
life
so
that
noth
should
disturb
you
or
make
you
move
you
have
hand
over
your

the
rest
of

while
you
sit
in

in

you
have
seen
noth
of

you
know
absolut
noth
of

and
are
onli
theoret

you
despis
suffer
and
are

at
noth
for
a
veri
simpl
reason
vaniti
of

the
extern
and
the
intern
contempt
for

for

and
for
death
comprehens
true

the
philosophi
that
suit
the
russian
sluggard
best
you
see
a
peasant
beat
his
wife
for
instanc
whi
interfer
let
him
beat
her
they
will
both
die
sooner
or
later
anyway
and
besid
he
who
beat
injur
by
his
blow
not
the
person
he
is
beat
but
himself
to
get
drunk
is
stupid
and
unseem
but
if
you
drink
you
die
and
if
you
dont
drink
you
die
a
peasant
woman
come
with

well
what
of

that
fantast
true
happi
there
no

of

we
are
kept
here
behind

tortur
left

but
that
is

and

becaus
there
is
no

between

said
andrey

with

oh

dare
say
well
if
you
had
a
stroke
of
paralysi
or
suppos
some
fool
or
bulli
took
advantag
of
his
posit
and
rank
to
insult
you
in
public
and
if
you
knew
he
could
do
it
with
impun
then
you
would
understand
what
it
mean
to
put
peopl
off
with
comprehens
and
true
happi
that
origin
said
andrey
yefimitch
laugh
with
pleasur
and
rub
his

i
am
agreeabl
struck
by
your
inclin
for

and
the
sketch
of

drawn
is
simpli
brilliant
i
must
confess
that
talk
to
you
give
me
great
pleasur

and
now
you
must
gracious
listen
to
me
xi
the
convers
went
on
for
about
an
hour
longer
and
appar
made
a
deep
impress
on
andrey
yefimitch
he
began
go
to
the
ward
everi
day
he
went
there
in
the
morn
and
after
dinner
and
often
the
dusk
of
even
found
him
in
convers
with
ivan
dmitritch
at
first
ivan
dmitritch
held
aloof
from
him
suspect
him
of
evil
design
and
open
express
his
hostil
but
afterward
he
got
use
to
him
and
his
abrupt
manner
chang
to
one
of
condescend
ironi
soon
it
was
all
over
the
hospit
that
the

now
from

time
till
even

he
lay
on
the

with
his

and
gave
himself
up
to

thought
which
he
could
not

was
mortifi
that
after
more
than
twenti
year
of

he
had
been
given
neither
a
pension
nor
ani
assist
it
is
true
that
he
had
not
done

but
then
all
who
are
in

get
a
pension
without
distinct
whether
they
are
honest
or
not
contemporari
justic
lie
precis
in

alon
to
be
an
except
he
had
no

and
told
lie
to
the
landladi
say
that
the
doctor
was
just
go
to
receiv
a
larg
sum
of

he
was
angri
with
himself
for
have
wast
on

the
thousand

he
had
save
up
how
use
that
thousand
roubl
would
have
been
now
he
was
vex
that
peopl
would
not
leav
him
in
peac
hobotov
thought
it
his
duti
to
look
in
on
his
sick
colleagu
from
time
to
time
everyth
about
him
was
revolt
to
andrey
yefimitchhi
well
fed
face
and
vulgar
condescend
tone
and
his
use
of
the
word
colleagu
and
his
high
top
boot
the
most
revolt
thing
was
that
he
thought
it
was
his
duti
to
treat
andrey
yefimitch
and
thought
that
he
realli
was
treat
him
on
everi
visit
he
brought
a
bottl
of
bromid
and
rhubarb
pill
mihail
averyanitch
too
thought
it
his
duti
to
visit
his

and
entertain
him
everi
time
he
went
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
with
an
affect
of
eas
laugh
constrain
and
began
assur
him
that
he
was
look
veri
well
to
day
and
that
thank
god
he
was
on
the
highroad
to
recoveri
and
from
this
it
might
be
conclud
that
he
look
on
his
friend
condit
as
hopeless
he
had
not
yet
repaid
his
warsaw
debt
and
was
overwhelm
by
shame
he
was
constrain
and
so
tri
to
laugh
louder
and
talk
more
amus
his
anecdot
and
descript
seem
endless
now
and
were
an
agoni
both
to
andrey
yefimitch
and
himself
in
his
presenc
andrey
yefimitch
usual
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
listen
with
his
teeth
clench
his
soul
was
oppress
with
rankl
disgust
and
after
everi
visit
from
his
friend
he
felt
as
though
this
disgust
had
risen
higher
and
was
mount
into
his
throat
to
stifl
petti
thought
he
made
hast
to
reflect
that
he
himself
and
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
all
sooner
or
later
perish
without
leav
ani
trace
on
the

if
one
imagin
some
spirit
fli
by
the
earth
globe
in
space
in
a
million
year
he
would
see
noth
but
clay

everythingcultur
and
the
moral
lawwould
pass
away
and
not
even
a

would
grow
out
of
them
of
what
consequ
was
shame
in

of
what
consequ
was
the
insignific
hobotov
or
the
wearisom
friendship
of
mihail
averyanitch
it
was
all
trivial
and
nonsens

such
reflect
did
not
help

when
hobotov
in
