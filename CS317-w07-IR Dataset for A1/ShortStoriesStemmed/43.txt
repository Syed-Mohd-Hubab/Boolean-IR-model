dusk
by
the
time
the

drove
out

station
on
the
surveyor
right
hand
stretch
a
dark
frozen
plain
endless
and
boundless
if
you
drove
over
it
you
would
certain
get
to
the
other
side
of
beyond
on
the
horizon
where
it
vanish
and
melt
into
the
sky
there
was
the
languid
glow
of
a
cold
autumn
sunset
on

mound
of
some
sort
that
might
be
last

side
was
cover
by
the
broad
clumsi
back
of
the

the
air
was
still
