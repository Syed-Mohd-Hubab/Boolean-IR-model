darkness

a young peasant with white eyebrows and eyelashes and broad cheekbones
in a torn sheepskin and big black felt overboots waited till the
zemstvo doctor had finished seeing his patients and came out to go home
from the hospital then he went up to him diffidently

please your honour he said

what do you want

the young man passed the palm of his hand up and over his nose looked
at the sky and then answered

please your honour    youve got my brother vaska the blacksmith
from varvarino in the convict ward here your honour   

yes what then

i am vaskas brother you see    father has the two of us him
vaska and me kirila besides us there are three sisters and vaskas a
married man with a little one    there are a lot of us and no one to
work    in the smithy its nearly two years now since the forge has
been heated i am at the cotton factory i cant do smiths work and
how can father work let alone work he cant eat properly he cant
lift the spoon to his mouth

what do you want from me

be merciful let vaska go

the doctor looked wonderingly at kirila and without saying a word
walked on the young peasant ran on in front and flung himself in a heap
at his feet

doctor kind gentleman he besought him balinking and again passing
his open hand over his nose show heavenly mercy let vaska go home we
shall remember you in our prayers for ever your honour let him go
they are all starving mothers wailing day in day out vaskas wifes
wailing    its worse than death i dont care to look upon the light
of day be merciful let him go kind gentleman

are you stupid or out of your senses asked the doctor angrily how
can i let him go why he is a convict

kirila began crying let him go

tfoo queer fellow what right have i am i a gaoler or what they
brought him to the hospital for me to treat him but i have as much
right to let him out as i have to put you in prison silly fellow

but they have shut him up for nothing he was in prison a year before
the trial and now there is no saying what he is there for it would
have been a different thing if he had murdered someone let us say or
stolen horses but as it is what is it all about

very likely but how do i come in

they shut a man up and they dont know themselves what for he was
drunk your honour did not know what he was doing and even hit father
on the ear and scratched his own cheek on a branch and two of our
fellowsthey wanted some turkish tobacco you see began telling him to
go with them and break into the armenians shop at night for tobacco
being drunk he obeyed them the fool they broke the lock you know
got in and did no end of mischief they turned everything upside down
broke the windows and scattered the flour about they were drunk that
is all one can say well the constable turned up    and with one
thing and another they took them off to the magistrate they have been a
whole year in prison and a week ago on the wednesday they were all
three tried in the town a soldier stood behind them with a gun   
people were sworn in vaska was less to blame than any but the gentry
decided that he was the ringleader the other two lads were sent to
prison but vaska to a convict battalion for three years and what for
one should judge like a christian

i have nothing to do with it i tell you again go to the authorities

i have been already ive been to the court i have tried to send in a
petitionthey wouldnt take a petition i have been to the police
captain and i have been to the examining magistrate and everyone says
it is not my business whose business is it then but there is no one
above you here in the hospital you do what you like your honour

you simpleton sighed the doctor once the jury have found him
guilty not the governor not even the minister could do anything let
alone the police captain its no good your trying to do anything

and who judged him then

the gentlemen of the jury   

they werent gentlemen they were our peasants andrey guryev was one
aloshka huk was one

well i am cold talking to you   

the doctor waved his hand and walked quickly to his own door kirila was
on the point of following him but seeing the door slam he stopped

for ten minutes he stood motionless in the middle of the hospital yard
and without putting on his cap stared at the doctors house then he
heaved a deep sigh slowly scratched himself and walked towards the
gate

to whom am i to go he muttered as he came out on to the road one
says it is not his business another says it is not his business whose
business is it then no till you grease their hands you will get
nothing out of them the doctor says that but he keeps looking all the
while at my fist to see whether i am going to give him a blue note
well brother ill go if it has to be to the governor

shifting from one foot to the other and continually looking round him in
an objectless way he trudged lazily along the road and was apparently
wondering where to go    it was not cold and the snow faintly
crunched under his feet not more than half a mile in front of him the
wretched little district town in which his brother had just been tried
lay outstretched on the hill on the right was the dark prison with its
red roof and sentry boxes at the corners on the left was the big town
copse now covered with hoar frost it was still only an old man
wearing a womans short jacket and a huge cap was walking ahead
coughing and shouting to a cow which he was driving to the town

good day grandfather said kirila overtaking him

good day   

are you driving it to the market

no the old man answered lazily

are you a townsman

they got into conversation kirila told him what he had come to the
hospital for and what he had been talking about to the doctor

the doctor does not know anything about such matters that is a sure
thing the old man said to him as they were both entering the town
though he is a gentleman he is only taught to cure by every means but
to give you real advice or let us say write out a petition for
youthat he cannot do there are special authorities to do that you
have been to the justice of the peace and to the police captainthey are
no good for your business either

where am i to go

the permanent member of the rural board is the chief person for
peasants affairs go to him mr sineokov

the one who is at zolotovo

why yes at zolotovo he is your chief man if it is anything that has
to do with you peasants even the police captain has no authority against
him

its a long way to go old man    i dare say its twelve miles and
may be more

one who needs something will go seventy

that is so    should i send in a petition to him or what

you will find out there if you should have a petition the clerk will
write you one quick enough the permanent member has a clerk

after parting from the old man kirila stood still in the middle of the
square thought a little and walked back out of the town he made up
his mind to go to zolotovo

five days later as the doctor was on his way home after seeing his
patients he caught sight of kirila again in his yard this time the
young peasant was not alone but with a gaunt very pale old man who
nodded his head without ceasing like a pendulum and mumbled with his
lips

your honour i have come again to ask your gracious mercy began
kirila here i have come with my father be merciful let vaska go the
permanent member would not talk to me he said go away

your honour the old man hissed in his throat raising his twitching
eyebrows be merciful we are poor people we cannot repay your honour
but if you graciously please kiryushka or vaska can repay you in work
let them work

we will pay with work said kirila and he raised his hand above his
head as though he would take an oath let him go they are starving
they are crying day and night your honour

the young peasant bent a rapid glance on his father pulled him by the
sleeve and both of them as at the word of command fell at the
doctors feet the latter waved his hand in despair and without
looking round walked quickly in at his door







the beggar

kind sir be so good as to notice a poor hungry man i have not tasted
food for three days i have not a five kopeck piece for a nights
lodging i swear by god for five years i was a village schoolmaster and
lost my post through the intrigues of the zemstvo i was the victim of
false witness i have been out of a place for a year now

skvortsov a petersburg lawyer looked at the speakers tattered dark
blue overcoat at his muddy drunken eyes at the red patches on his
cheeks and it seemed to him that he had seen the man before

and now i am offered a post in the kaluga province the beggar
continued but i have not the means for the journey there graciously
help me i am ashamed to ask but    i am compelled by
circumstances

skvortsov looked at his goloshes of which one was shallow like a shoe
while the other came high up the leg like a boot and suddenly
remembered

listen the day before yesterday i met you in sadovoy street he said
and then you told me not that you were a village schoolmaster but
that you were a student who had been expelled do you remember

n o no that cannot be so the beggar muttered in confusion i am a
village schoolmaster and if you wish it i can show you documents to
prove it

thats enough lies you called yourself a student and even told me
what you were expelled for do you remember

skvortsov flushed and with a look of disgust on his face turned away
from the ragged figure

its contemptible sir he cried angrily its a swindle ill hand
you over to the police damn you you are poor and hungry but that does
not give you the right to lie so shamelessly

the ragged figure took hold of the door handle and like a bird in a
snare looked round the hall desperately

i    i am not lying he muttered i can show documents

who can believe you skvortsov went on still indignant to exploit
the sympathy of the public for village schoolmasters and studentsits
so low so mean so dirty its revolting

skvortsov flew into a rage and gave the beggar a merciless scolding the
ragged fellows insolent lying aroused his disgust and aversion was an
offence against what he skvortsov loved and prized in himself
kindliness a feeling heart sympathy for the unhappy by his lying by
his treacherous assault upon compassion the individual had as it were
defiled the charity which he liked to give to the poor with no
misgivings in his heart the beggar at first defended himself protested
with oaths then he sank into silence and hung his head overcome with
shame

sir he said laying his hand on his heart i really was    lying
i am not a student and not a village schoolmaster all thats mere
invention i used to be in the russian choir and i was turned out of it
for drunkenness but what can i do believe me in gods name i cant
get on without lyingwhen i tell the truth no one will give me anything
with the truth one may die of hunger and freeze without a nights
lodging what you say is true i understand that but    what am i to
do

what are you to do you ask what are you to do cried skvortsov going
close up to him workthats what you must do you must work

work    i know that myself but where can i get work

nonsense you are young strong and healthy and could always find
work if you wanted to but you know you are lazy pampered drunken you
reek of vodka like a pothouse you have become false and corrupt to the
marrow of your bones and fit for nothing but begging and lying if you
do graciously condescend to take work you must have a job in an office
in the russian choir or as a billiard marker where you will have a
salary and have nothing to do but how would you like to undertake
manual labour ill be bound you wouldnt be a house porter or a
factory hand you are too genteel for that

what things you say really    said the beggar and he gave a
bitter smile how can i get manual work its rather late for me to be
a shopman for in trade one has to begin from a boy no one would take
me as a house porter because i am not of that class     and i could
not get work in a factory one must know a trade and i know nothing

nonsense you always find some justification wouldnt you like to chop
wood

i would not refuse to but the regular woodchoppers are out of work
now

oh all idlers argue like that as soon as you are offered anything you
refuse it would you care to chop wood for me

certainly i will  

very good we shall see    excellent well see skvortsov in
nervous haste and not without malignant pleasure rubbing his hands
summoned his cook from the kitchen

here olga he said to her take this gentleman to the shed and let
him chop some wood

the beggar shrugged his shoulders as though puzzled and irresolutely
followed the cook it was evident from his demeanour that he had
consented to go and chop wood not because he was hungry and wanted to
earn money but simply from shame and amour propre because he had been
taken at his word it was clear too that he was suffering from the
effects of vodka that he was unwell and felt not the faintest
inclination to work

skvortsov hurried into the dining room there from the window which
looked out into the yard he could see the woodshed and everything that
happened in the yard standing at the window skvortsov saw the cook and
the beggar come by the back way into the yard and go through the muddy
snow to the woodshed olga scrutinized her companion angrily and
jerking her elbow unlocked the woodshed and angrily banged the door
open

most likely we interrupted the woman drinking her coffee thought
skvortsov what a cross creature she is

then he saw the pseudo schoolmaster and pseudo student seat himself on a
block of wood and leaning his red cheeks upon his fists sink into
thought the cook flung an axe at his feet spat angrily on the ground
and judging by the expression of her lips began abusing him the
beggar drew a log of wood towards him irresolutely set it up between
his feet and diffidently drew the axe across it the log toppled and
fell over the beggar drew it towards him breathed on his frozen hands
and again drew the axe along it as cautiously as though he were afraid
of its hitting his golosh or chopping off his fingers the log fell over
again

skvortsovs wrath had passed off by now he felt sore and ashamed at the
thought that he had forced a pampered drunken and perhaps sick man to
do hard rough work in the cold

never mind let him go on    he thought going from the dining room
into his study i am doing it for his good

an hour later olga appeared and announced that the wood had been chopped
up

here give him half a rouble said skvortsov if he likes let him
come and chop wood on the first of every month    there will always
be work for him

on the first of the month the beggar turned up and again earned half a
rouble though he could hardly stand from that time forward he took to
turning up frequently and work was always found for him sometimes he
would sweep the snow into heaps or clear up the shed at another he
used to beat the rugs and the mattresses he always received thirty to
forty kopecks for his work and on one occasion an old pair of trousers
was sent out to him

when he moved skvortsov engaged him to assist in packing and moving the
furniture on this occasion the beggar was sober gloomy and silent he
scarcely touched the furniture walked with hanging head behind the
furniture vans and did not even try to appear busy he merely shivered
with the cold and was overcome with confusion when the men with the
vans laughed at his idleness feebleness and ragged coat that had once
been a gentlemans after the removal skvortsov sent for him

well i see my words have had an effect upon you he said giving him
a rouble this is for your work i see that you are sober and not
disinclined to work what is your name

lushkov

i can offer you better work not so rough lushkov can you write

yes sir

then go with this note to morrow to my colleague and he will give you
some copying to do work dont drink and dont forget what i said to
you good bye

skvortsov pleased that he had put a man in the path of rectitude
patted lushkov genially on the shoulder and even shook hands with him
at parting

lushkov took the letter departed and from that time forward did not
come to the back yard for work

two years passed one day as skvortsov was standing at the ticket office
of a theatre paying for his ticket he saw beside him a little man with
a lambskin collar and a shabby cats skin cap the man timidly asked the
clerk for a gallery ticket and paid for it with kopecks

lushkov is it you asked skvortsov recognizing in the little man his
former woodchopper well what are you doing are you getting on all
right

pretty well    i am in a notarys office now i earn thirty five
roubles

well thank god thats capital i rejoice for you i am very very
glad lushkov you know in a way you are my godson it was i who
shoved you into the right way do you remember what a scolding i gave
you eh you almost sank through the floor that time well thank you
my dear fellow for remembering my words

thank you too said lushkov if i had not come to you that day maybe
i should be calling myself a schoolmaster or a student still yes in
your house i was saved and climbed out of the pit

i am very very glad

thank you for your kind words and deeds what you said that day was
excellent i am grateful to you and to your cook god bless that kind
noble hearted woman what you said that day was excellent i am indebted
to you as long as i live of course but it was your cook olga who
really saved me

how was that

why it was like this i used to come to you to chop wood and she would
begin ah you drunkard you god forsaken man and yet death does not
take you and then she would sit opposite me lamenting looking into
my face and wailing you unlucky fellow you have no gladness in this
world and in the next you will burn in hell poor drunkard you poor
sorrowful creature and she always went on in that style you know how
often she upset herself and how many tears she shed over me i cant
tell you but what affected me mostshe chopped the wood for me do you
know sir i never chopped a single log for youshe did it all how it
was she saved me how it was i changed looking at her and gave up
drinking i cant explain i only know that what she said and the noble
way she behaved brought about a change in my soul and i shall never
forget it its time to go up though they are just going to ring the
bell

lushkov bowed and went off to the gallery
