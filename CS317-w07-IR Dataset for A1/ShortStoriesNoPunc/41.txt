oh the public

here goes ive done with drinking nothing   nothing shall tempt
me to it its time to take myself in hand i must buck up and work  
youre glad to get your salary so you must do your work honestly
heartily conscientiously regardless of sleep and comfort chuck taking
it easy youve got into the way of taking a salary for nothing my
boythats not the right thing    not the right thing at all   

after administering to himself several such lectures podtyagin the head
ticket collector begins to feel an irresistible impulse to get to work
it is past one oclock at night but in spite of that he wakes the
ticket collectors and with them goes up and down the railway carriages
inspecting the tickets

tttickets    pppplease he keeps shouting briskly snapping
the clippers

sleepy figures shrouded in the twilight of the railway carriages
start shake their heads and produce their tickets

ttttickets please podtyagin addresses a secondclass passenger a
lean scraggylooking man wrapped up in a fur coat and a rug and
surrounded with pillows tickets please

the scraggylooking man makes no reply he is buried in sleep the head
ticketcollector touches him on the shoulder and repeats impatiently
tttickets ppplease

the passenger starts opens his eyes and gazes in alarm at podtyagin

what    who    eh

youre asked in plain language tttickets ppplease if you
please

my god moans the scraggylooking man pulling a woebegone face good
heavens im suffering from rheumatism    i havent slept for three
nights ive just taken morphia on purpose to get to sleep and you  
 with your tickets its merciless its inhuman if you knew how hard
it is for me to sleep you wouldnt disturb me for such nonsense   
its cruel its absurd and what do you want with my ticket its
positively stupid

podtyagin considers whether to take offence or notand decides to take
offence

dont shout here this is not a tavern

no in a tavern people are more humane   coughs the passenger
perhaps youll let me go to sleep another time its extraordinary
ive travelled abroad all over the place and no one asked for my
ticket there but here youre at it again and again as though the devil
were after you   

well youd better go abroad again since you like it so much

its stupid sir yes as though its not enough killing the passengers
with fumes and stuffiness and draughts they want to strangle us with
red tape too damn it all he must have the ticket my goodness what
zeal if it were of any use to the companybut half the passengers are
travelling without a ticket

listen sir cries podtyagin flaring up if you dont leave off
shouting and disturbing the public i shall be obliged to put you out at
the next station and to draw up a report on the incident

this is revolting exclaims the public growing indignant
persecuting an invalid listen and have some consideration

but the gentleman himself was abusive says podtyagin a little
scared very well    i wont take the ticket    as you like  
  only of course as you know very well its my duty to do so   
if it were not my duty then of course   you can ask the station
master    ask anyone you like   

podtyagin shrugs his shoulders and walks away from the invalid at first
he feels aggrieved and somewhat injured then after passing through two
or three carriages he begins to feel a certain uneasiness not unlike
the pricking of conscience in his ticketcollectors bosom

there certainly was no need to wake the invalid he thinks though it
was not my fault   they imagine i did it wantonly idly they dont
know that im bound in duty    if they dont believe it i can bring
the stationmaster to them a station the train stops five minutes
before the third bell podtyagin enters the same secondclass carriage
behind him stalks the stationmaster in a red cap

this gentleman here podtyagin begins declares that i have no right
to ask for his ticket and    and is offended at it i ask you mr
stationmaster to explain to him    do i ask for tickets according
to regulation or to please myself sir podtyagin addresses the
scraggylooking man sir you can ask the stationmaster here if you
dont believe me

the invalid starts as though he had been stung opens his eyes and with
a woebegone face sinks back in his seat

my god i have taken another powder and only just dozed off when here
he is again   again i beseech you have some pity on me

you can ask the stationmaster    whether i have the right to demand
your ticket or not

this is insufferable take your ticket   take it ill pay for five
extra if youll only let me die in peace have you never been ill
yourself heartless people

this is simply persecution a gentleman in military uniform grows
indignant i can see no other explanation of this persistence

drop it    says the stationmaster frowning and pulling podtyagin
by the sleeve

podtyagin shrugs his shoulders and slowly walks after the station
master

theres no pleasing them he thinks bewildered it was for his sake
i brought the stationmaster that he might understand and be pacified
and he    swears

another station the train stops ten minutes before the second bell
while podtyagin is standing at the refreshment bar drinking seltzer
water two gentlemen go up to him one in the uniform of an engineer
and the other in a military overcoat

look here ticketcollector the engineer begins addressing
podtyagin your behaviour to that invalid passenger has revolted all
who witnessed it my name is puzitsky i am an engineer and this
gentleman is a colonel if you do not apologize to the passenger we
shall make a complaint to the traffic manager who is a friend of ours

gentlemen why of course i    why of course you    podtyagin is
panicstricken

we dont want explanations but we warn you if you dont apologize we
shall see justice done to him

certainly i    ill apologize of course   to be sure   

half an hour later podtyagin having thought of an apologetic phrase
which would satisfy the passenger without lowering his own dignity
walks into the carriage sir he addresses the invalid listen sir
  

the invalid starts and leaps up what

i    what was it    you mustnt be offended   

och water    gasps the invalid clutching at his heart id just
taken a third dose of morphia dropped asleep and    again good
god when will this torture cease

i only    you must excuse   

oh    put me out at the next station i cant stand any more   
 i    i am dying   

this is mean disgusting cry the public revolted go away you
shall pay for such persecution get away

podtyagin waves his hand in despair sighs and walks out of the
carriage he goes to the attendants compartment sits down at the
table exhausted and complains

oh the public theres no satisfying them its no use working and
doing ones best ones driven to drinking and cursing it all     if
you do nothingtheyre angry if you begin doing your duty theyre
angry too theres nothing for it but drink

podtyagin empties a bottle straight off and thinks no more of work
duty and honesty
