frost

a popular fte with a philanthropic object had been arranged on the
feast of epiphany in the provincial town of n they had selected a
broad part of the river between the market and the bishops palace
fenced it round with a rope with fir trees and with flags and provided
everything necessary for skating sledging and tobogganing the
festivity was organized on the grandest scale possible the notices that
were distributed were of huge size and promised a number of delights
skating a military band a lottery with no blank tickets an electric
sun and so on but the whole scheme almost came to nothing owing to the
hard frost from the eve of epiphany there were twenty eight degrees of
frost with a strong wind it was proposed to put off the fte and this
was not done only because the public which for a long while had been
looking forward to the fte impatiently would not consent to any
postponement

only think what do you expect in winter but a frost said the ladies
persuading the governor who tried to insist that the fte should be
postponed if anyone is cold he can go and warm himself

the trees the horses the mens beards were white with frost it even
seemed that the air itself crackled as though unable to endure the
cold but in spite of that the frozen public were skating immediately
after the blessing of the waters and precisely at one oclock the
military band began playing

between three and four oclock in the afternoon when the festivity was
at its height the select society of the place gathered together to warm
themselves in the governors pavilion which had been put up on the
river bank the old governor and his wife the bishop the president of
the local court the head master of the high school and many others
were there the ladies were sitting in armchairs while the men crowded
round the wide glass door looking at the skating

holy saints said the bishop in surprise what flourishes they
execute with their legs upon my soul many a singer couldnt do a twirl
with his voice as those cut throats do with their legs aie hell kill
himself

thats smirnov    thats gruzdev    said the head master
mentioning the names of the schoolboys who flew by the pavilion

bah hes all alive oh laughed the governor look gentlemen our
mayor is coming    he is coming this way    thats a nuisance
he will talk our heads off now

a little thin old man wearing a big cap and a fur lined coat hanging
open came from the opposite bank towards the pavilion avoiding the
skaters this was the mayor of the town a merchant eremeyev by name a
millionaire and an old inhabitant of n flinging wide his arms and
shrugging at the cold he skipped along knocking one golosh against the
other evidently in haste to get out of the wind half way he suddenly
bent down stole up to some lady and plucked at her sleeve from behind
when she looked round he skipped away and probably delighted at having
succeeded in frightening her went off into a loud aged laugh

lively old fellow said the governor its a wonder hes not
skating

as he got near the pavilion the mayor fell into a little tripping trot
waved his hands and taking a run slid along the ice in his huge
golosh boots up to the very door

yegor ivanitch you ought to get yourself some skates the governor
greeted him

thats just what i am thinking he answered in a squeaky somewhat
nasal tenor taking off his cap i wish you good health your
excellency your holiness long life to all the other gentlemen and
ladies heres a frost yes it is a frost bother it its deadly

winking with his red frozen eyes yegor ivanitch stamped on the floor
with his golosh boots and swung his arms together like a frozen cabman

such a damnable frost worse than any dog he went on talking smiling
all over his face its a real affliction

its healthy said the governor frost strengthens a man and makes
him vigorous   

though it may be healthy it would be better without it at all said
the mayor wiping his wedge shaped beard with a red handkerchief it
would be a good riddance to my thinking your excellency the lord
sends it us as a punishmentthe frost i mean we sin in the summer and
are punished in the winter    yes

yegor ivanitch looked round him quickly and flung up his hands

why wheres the needful    to warm us up he asked looking in
alarm first at the governor and then at the bishop your excellency
your holiness ill be bound the ladies are frozen too we must have
something this wont do

everyone began gesticulating and declaring that they had not come to the
skating to warm themselves but the mayor heeding no one opened the
door and beckoned to someone with his crooked finger a workman and a
fireman ran up to him

here run off to savatin he muttered and tell him to make haste and
send here    what do you call it    whats it to be tell him to
send a dozen glasses    a dozen glasses of mulled wine the very
hottest or punch perhaps   

there was laughter in the pavilion

a nice thing to treat us to

never mind we will drink it muttered the mayor a dozen glasses
then    and some benedictine perhaps    and tell them to warm two
bottles of red wine    oh and what for the ladies well you tell
them to bring cakes nuts    sweets of some sort perhaps   
there run along look sharp

the mayor was silent for a minute and then began again abusing the
frost banging his arms across his chest and thumping with his golosh
boots

no yegor ivanitch said the governor persuasively dont be unfair
the russian frost has its charms i was reading lately that many of the
good qualities of the russian people are due to the vast expanse of
their land and to the climate the cruel struggle for existence   
thats perfectly true

it may be true your excellency but it would be better without it the
frost did drive out the french of course and one can freeze all sorts
of dishes and the children can go skatingthats all true for the man
who is well fed and well clothed the frost is only a pleasure but for
the working man the beggar the pilgrim the crazy wanderer its the
greatest evil and misfortune its misery your holiness in a frost
like this poverty is twice as hard and the thief is more cunning and
evildoers more violent theres no gainsaying it i am turned seventy
ive a fur coat now and at home i have a stove and rums and punches of
all sorts the frost means nothing to me now i take no notice of it i
dont care to know of it but how it used to be in old days holy
mother its dreadful to recall it my memory is failing me with years
and i have forgotten everything my enemies and my sins and troubles of
all sortsi forget them all but the frostough how i remember it when
my mother died i was left a little devilthis higha homeless orphan  
 no kith nor kin wretched ragged little clothes hungry nowhere to
sleepin fact we have here no abiding city but seek the one to come
in those days i used to lead an old blind woman about the town for five
kopecks a day    the frosts were cruel wicked one would go out with
the old woman and begin suffering torments my creator first of all you
would be shivering as in a fever shrugging and dancing about then your
ears your fingers your feet would begin aching they would ache as
though someone were squeezing them with pincers but all that would have
been nothing a trivial matter of no great consequence the trouble was
when your whole body was chilled one would walk for three blessed hours
in the frost your holiness and lose all human semblance your legs are
drawn up there is a weight on your chest your stomach is pinched
above all there is a pain in your heart that is worse than anything
your heart aches beyond all endurance and there is a wretchedness all
over your body as though you were leading death by the hand instead of
an old woman you are numb all over turned to stone like a statue you
go on and feel as though it were not you walking but someone else
moving your legs instead of you when your soul is frozen you dont know
what you are doing you are ready to leave the old woman with no one to
guide her or to pull a hot roll from off a hawkers tray or to fight
with someone and when you come to your nights lodging into the warmth
after the frost there is not much joy in that either you lie awake
till midnight crying and dont know yourself what you are crying for
  

we must walk about the skating ground before it gets dark said the
governors wife who was bored with listening whos coming with me

the governors wife went out and the whole company trooped out of the
pavilion after her only the governor the bishop and the mayor
remained

queen of heaven and what i went through when i was a shopboy in a
fish shop yegor ivanitch went on flinging up his arms so that his
fox lined coat fell open one would go out to the shop almost before it
was light    by eight oclock i was completely frozen my face was
blue my fingers were stiff so that i could not fasten my buttons nor
count the money one would stand in the cold turn numb and think
lord i shall have to stand like this right on till evening by
dinner time my stomach was pinched and my heart was aching    yes
and i was not much better afterwards when i had a shop of my own the
frost was intense and the shop was like a mouse trap with draughts
blowing in all directions the coat i had on was pardon me mangy as
thin as paper threadbare    one would be chilled through and
through half dazed and turn as cruel as the frost oneself i would
pull one by the ear so that i nearly pulled the ear off i would smack
another on the back of the head id glare at a customer like a ruffian
a wild beast and be ready to fleece him and when i got home in the
evening and ought to have gone to bed id be ill humoured and set upon
my family throwing it in their teeth that they were living upon me i
would make a row and carry on so that half a dozen policemen couldnt
have managed me the frost makes one spiteful and drives one to drink

yegor ivanitch clasped his hands and went on

and when we were taking fish to moscow in the winter holy mother and
spluttering as he talked he began describing the horrors he endured
with his shopmen when he was taking fish to moscow   

yes sighed the governor it is wonderful what a man can endure you
used to take wagon loads of fish to moscow yegor ivanitch while i in
my time was at the war i remember one extraordinary instance   

and the governor described how during the last russo turkish war one
frosty night the division in which he was had stood in the snow without
moving for thirteen hours in a piercing wind from fear of being
observed the division did not light a fire nor make a sound or a
movement they were forbidden to smoke   

reminiscences followed the governor and the mayor grew lively and good 
humoured and interrupting each other began recalling their
experiences and the bishop told them how when he was serving in
siberia he had travelled in a sledge drawn by dogs how one day being
drowsy in a time of sharp frost he had fallen out of the sledge and
been nearly frozen when the tunguses turned back and found him he was
barely alive then as by common agreement the old men suddenly sank
into silence sat side by side and mused

ech whispered the mayor youd think it would be time to forget but
when you look at the water carriers at the schoolboys at the convicts
in their wretched gowns it brings it all back why only take those
musicians who are playing now ill be bound there is a pain in their
hearts a pinch at their stomachs and their trumpets are freezing to
their lips    they play and think holy mother we have another
three hours to sit here in the cold

the old men sank into thought they thought of that in man which is
higher than good birth higher than rank and wealth and learning of
that which brings the lowest beggar near to god of the helplessness of
man of his sufferings and his patience   

meanwhile the air was turning blue    the door opened and two waiters
from savatins walked in carrying trays and a big muffled teapot when
the glasses had been filled and there was a strong smell of cinnamon and
clove in the air the door opened again and there came into the
pavilion a beardless young policeman whose nose was crimson and who was
covered all over with frost he went up to the governor and saluting
said her excellency told me to inform you that she has gone home

looking at the way the policeman put his stiff frozen fingers to his
cap looking at his nose his lustreless eyes and his hood covered with
white frost near the mouth they all for some reason felt that this
policemans heart must be aching that his stomach must feel pinched
and his soul numb   

i say said the governor hesitatingly have a drink of mulled wine

its all right    its all right drink it up the mayor urged him
gesticulating dont be shy

the policeman took the glass in both hands moved aside and trying to
drink without making any sound began discreetly sipping from the glass
he drank and was overwhelmed with embarrassment while the old men looked
at him in silence and they all fancied that the pain was leaving the
young policemans heart and that his soul was thawing the governor
heaved a sigh

its time we were at home he said getting up good bye i say he
added addressing the policeman tell the musicians there to   
leave off playing and ask pavel semyonovitch from me to see they are
given    beer or vodka

the governor and the bishop said good bye to the mayor and went out of
the pavilion

yegor ivanitch attacked the mulled wine and before the policeman had
finished his glass succeeded in telling him a great many interesting
things he could not be silent
