a play

pavel vassilyevitch theres a lady here asking for you luka
announced shes been waiting a good hour   

pavel vassilyevitch had only just finished lunch hearing of the lady
he frowned and said

oh damn her tell her im busy

she has been here five times already pavel vassilyevitch she says she
really must see you    shes almost crying

hm    very well then ask her into the study

without haste pavel vassilyevitch put on his coat took a pen in one
hand and a book in the other and trying to look as though he were very
busy he went into the study there the visitor was awaiting him a large
stout lady with a red beefy face in spectacles she looked very
respectable and her dress was more than fashionable she had on a
crinolette of four storeys and a high hat with a reddish bird in it on
seeing him she turned up her eyes and folded her hands in supplication

you dont remember me of course she began in a high masculine tenor
visibly agitated i    i have had the pleasure of meeting you at the
hrutskys    i am mme murashkin   

a   a    a    hm    sit down what can i do for you

you    you see    i    i    the lady went on sitting down
and becoming still more agitated you dont remember me    im mme
murashkin    you see im a great admirer of your talent and always
read your articles with great enjoyment    dont imagine im
flattering you god forbid im only giving honour where honour is due 
  i am always reading you    always to some extent i am myself not
a stranger to literature  that is of course    i will not venture to
call myself an authoress but    still i have added my little quota 
  i have published at different times three stories for children  
 you have not read them of course    i have translated a good deal
and    and my late brother used to write for the cause

to be sure    er er er  what can i do for you

you see    the lady cast down her eyes and turned redder i know
your talents    your views pavel vassilyevitch and i have been
longing to learn your opinion or more exactly    to ask your advice
i must tell you i have perpetrated a play my first born  pardon pour
lexpression and before sending it to the censor i should like above
all things to have your opinion on it

nervously with the flutter of a captured bird the lady fumbled in her
skirt and drew out a fat manuscript

pavel vassilyevitch liked no articles but his own when threatened with
the necessity of reading other peoples or listening to them he felt
as though he were facing the cannons mouth seeing the manuscript he
took fright and hastened to say

very good    leave it    ill read it

pavel vassilyevitch the lady said languishingly clasping her hands
and raising them in supplication i know youre busy    your every
minute is precious and i know youre inwardly cursing me at this
moment but    be kind allow me to read you my play     do be so
very sweet

i should be delighted    faltered pavel vassilyevitch but madam
im    im very busy     im    im obliged to set off this
minute

pavel vassilyevitch moaned the lady and her eyes filled with tears
im asking a sacrifice i am insolent i am intrusive but be
magnanimous to morrow im leaving for kazan and i should like to know
your opinion to day grant me half an hour of your attention    only
one half hour    i implore you

pavel vassilyevitch was cotton wool at core and could not refuse when
it seemed to him that the lady was about to burst into sobs and fall on
her knees he was overcome with confusion and muttered helplessly

very well certainly    i will listen    i will give you half an
hour

the lady uttered a shriek of joy took off her hat and settling herself
began to read at first she read a scene in which a footman and a house
maid tidying up a sumptuous drawing room talked at length about their
young lady anna sergyevna who was building a school and a hospital in
the village when the footman had left the room the maidservant
pronounced a monologue to the effect that education is light and
ignorance is darkness then mme murashkin brought the footman back into
the drawing room and set him uttering a long monologue concerning his
master the general who disliked his daughters views intended to
marry her to a rich kammer junker and held that the salvation of the
people lay in unadulterated ignorance then when the servants had left
the stage the young lady herself appeared and informed the audience
that she had not slept all night but had been thinking of valentin
ivanovitch who was the son of a poor teacher and assisted his sick
father gratuitously valentin had studied all the sciences but had no
faith in friendship nor in love he had no object in life and longed for
death and therefore she the young lady must save him

pavel vassilyevitch listened and thought with yearning anguish of his
sofa he scanned the lady viciously felt her masculine tenor thumping
on his eardrums understood nothing and thought

the devil sent you    as though i wanted to listen to your tosh
its not my fault youve written a play is it my god what a thick
manuscript what an infliction

pavel vassilyevitch glanced at the wall where the portrait of his wife
was hanging and remembered that his wife had asked him to buy and bring
to their summer cottage five yards of tape a pound of cheese and some
tooth powder

i hope ive not lost the pattern of that tape he thought where did
i put it i believe its in my blue reefer jacket    those wretched
flies have covered her portrait with spots already i must tell olga to
wash the glass    shes reading the twelfth scene so we must soon
be at the end of the first act as though inspiration were possible in
this heat and with such a mountain of flesh too instead of writing
plays shed much better eat cold vinegar hash and sleep in a cellar  


you dont think that monologues a little too long the lady asked
suddenly raising her eyes

pavel vassilyevitch had not heard the monologue and said in a voice as
guilty as though not the lady but he had written that monologue

no no not at all its very nice   

the lady beamed with happiness and continued reading

anna you are consumed by analysis too early you have ceased to live in
the heart and have put your faith in the intellect

valentin what do you mean by the heart that is a concept of anatomy
as a conventional term for what are called the feelings i do not admit
it

anna confused and love surely that is not merely a product of the
association of ideas tell me frankly have you ever loved

valentin bitterly let us not touch on old wounds not yet healed a
pause what are you thinking of

anna i believe you are unhappy

during the sixteenth scene pavel vassilyevitch yawned and accidently
made with his teeth the sound dogs make when they catch a fly he was
dismayed at this unseemly sound and to cover it assumed an expression
of rapt attention

scene seventeen when will it end he thought oh my god if this
torture is prolonged another ten minutes i shall shout for the police
its insufferable

but at last the lady began reading more loudly and more rapidly and
finally raising her voice she read curtain

pavel vassilyevitch uttered a faint sigh and was about to get up but
the lady promptly turned the page and went on reading

act ii scene a village street on right school on left hospital
villagers male and female sitting on the hospital steps

excuse me pavel vassilyevitch broke in how many acts are there

five answered the lady and at once as though fearing her audience
might escape her she went on rapidly

valentin is looking out of the schoolhouse window in the background
villagers can be seen taking their goods to the inn

like a man condemned to be executed and convinced of the impossibility
of a reprieve pavel vassilyevitch gave up expecting the end abandoned
all hope and simply tried to prevent his eyes from closing and to
retain an expression of attention on his face    the future when the
lady would finish her play and depart seemed to him so remote that he
did not even think of it

trooo too too too    the ladys voice sounded in his ears
troo too too    sh sh sh sh   

i forgot to take my soda he thought what am i thinking about oh my
soda    most likely i shall have a bilious attack    its
extraordinary smirnovsky swills vodka all day long and yet he never has
a bilious attack    theres a bird settled on the window    a
sparrow   

pavel vassilyevitch made an effort to unglue his strained and closing
eyelids yawned without opening his mouth and stared at mme murashkin
she grew misty and swayed before his eyes turned into a triangle and
her head pressed against the ceiling   

valentin no let me depart

anna in dismay why

valentin aside she has turned pale to her do not force me to
explain sooner would i die than you should know the reason

anna after a pause you cannot go away   

the lady began to swell swelled to an immense size and melted into the
dingy atmosphere of the study only her moving mouth was visible then
she suddenly dwindled to the size of a bottle swayed from side to side
and with the table retreated to the further end of the room   

valentin holding anna in his arms you have given me new life you
have shown me an object to live for you have renewed me as the spring
rain renews the awakened earth but    it is too late too late the
ill that gnaws at my heart is beyond cure   

pavel vassilyevitch started and with dim and smarting eyes stared at the
reading lady for a minute he gazed fixedly as though understanding
nothing   

scene xi the same the baron and the police inspector with assistants

valentin take me

anna i am his take me too yes take me too i love him i love him
more than life

baron anna sergyevna you forget that you are ruining your father   


the lady began swelling again    looking round him wildly pavel
vassilyevitch got up yelled in a deep unnatural voice snatched from
the table a heavy paper weight and beside himself brought it down with
all his force on the authoresss head   





give me in charge ive killed her he said to the maidservant who ran
in a minute later

the jury acquitted him
