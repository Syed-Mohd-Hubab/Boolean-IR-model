the petchenyeg

ivan abramitch zhmuhin a retired cossack officer who had once served
in the caucasus but now lived on his own farm and who had once been
young strong and vigorous but now was old dried up and bent with
shaggy eyebrows and a greenishgrey moustache was returning from the
town to his farm one hot summers day in the town he had confessed and
received absolution and had made his will at the notarys a fortnight
before he had had a slight stroke and now all the while he was in the
railway carriage he was haunted by melancholy serious thoughts of
approaching death of the vanity of vanities of the transitoriness of
all things earthly at the station of provalyethere is such a one on
the donetz linea fairhaired plump middleaged gentleman with a
shabby portfolio stepped into the carriage and sat down opposite they
got into conversation

yes said ivan abramitch looking pensively out of window it is
never too late to marry i myself married when i was fortyeight i was
told it was late but it has turned out that it was not late or early
but simply that it would have been better not to marry at all everyone
is soon tired of his wife but not everyone tells the truth because
you know people are ashamed of an unhappy home life and conceal it
its manya this and manya that with many a man by his wifes side
but if he had his way hed put that manya in a sack and drop her in the
water its dull with ones wife its mere foolishness and its no
better with ones children i make bold to assure you i have two of
them the rascals theres nowhere for them to be taught out here in the
steppe i havent the money to send them to school in novo tcherkask
and they live here like young wolves next thing they will be murdering
someone on the highroad

the fairhaired gentleman listened attentively answered questions
briefly in a low voice and was apparently a gentleman of gentle and
modest disposition he mentioned that he was a lawyer and that he was
going to the village dyuevka on business

why merciful heavens that is six miles from me said zhmuhin in a
tone of voice as though someone were disputing with him but excuse me
you wont find horses at the station now to my mind the very best
thing you can do you know is to come straight to me stay the night
you know and in the morning drive over with my horses

the lawyer thought a moment and accepted the invitation

when they reached the station the sun was already low over the steppe
they said nothing all the way from the station to the farm the jolting
prevented conversation the trap bounded up and down squeaked and
seemed to be sobbing and the lawyer who was sitting very
uncomfortably stared before him miserably hoping to see the farm
after they had driven five or six miles there came into view in the
distance a lowpitched house and a yard enclosed by a fence made of
dark flat stones standing on end the roof was green the stucco was
peeling off and the windows were little narrow slits like screwedup
eyes the farm stood in the full sunshine and there was no sign either
of water or trees anywhere round among the neighbouring landowners and
the peasants it was known as the petchenyegs farm many years before a
land surveyor who was passing through the neighbourhood and put up at
the farm spent the whole night talking to ivan abramitch was not
favourably impressed and as he was driving away in the morning said to
him grimly

you are a petchenyeg my good sir

 the petchenyegs were a tribe of wild mongolian nomads who made
frequent inroads upon the russians in the tenth and eleventh
centuriestranslators note

from this came the nickname the petchenyegs farm which stuck to the
place even more when zhmuhins boys grew up and began to make raids on
the orchards and kitchengardens ivan abramitch was called you know
as he usually talked a very great deal and frequently made use of that
expression

in the yard near a barn zhmuhins sons were standing one a young man of
nineteen the other a younger lad both barefoot and bareheaded just at
the moment when the trap drove into the yard the younger one flung high
up a hen which cackling described an arc in the air the elder shot at
it with a gun and the hen fell dead on the earth

those are my boys learning to shoot birds flying said zhmuhin

in the entry the travellers were met by a little thin woman with a pale
face still young and beautiful from her dress she might have been
taken for a servant

and this allow me to introduce her said zhmuhin is the mother of
my young cubs come lyubov osipovna he said addressing her you
must be spry mother and get something for our guest let us have
supper look sharp

the house consisted of two parts in one was the parlour and beside it
old zhmuhins bedroom both stuffy rooms with low ceilings and
multitudes of flies and wasps and in the other was the kitchen in which
the cooking and washing was done and the labourers had their meals here
geese and turkeyhens were sitting on their eggs under the benches and
here were the beds of lyubov osipovna and her two sons the furniture in
the parlour was unpainted and evidently roughly made by a carpenter
guns gamebags and whips were hanging on the walls and all this old
rubbish was covered with the rust of years and looked grey with dust
there was not one picture in the corner was a dingy board which had at
one time been an ikon

a young little russian woman laid the table and handed ham then
beetroot soup the visitor refused vodka and ate only bread and
cucumbers

how about ham asked zhmuhin

thank you i dont eat it answered the visitor i dont eat meat at
all

why is that

i am a vegetarian killing animals is against my principles

zhmuhin thought a minute and then said slowly with a sigh

yes    to be sure    i saw a man who did not eat meat in town
too its a new religion theyve got now well its good we cant go
on always shooting and slaughtering you know we must give it up some
day and leave even the beasts in peace its a sin to kill its a sin
there is no denying it sometimes one kills a hare and wounds him in the
leg and he cries like a child    so it must hurt him

of course it hurts him animals suffer just like human beings

thats true zhmuhin assented i understand that very well he went
on musing only there is this one thing i dont understand suppose
you know everyone gave up eating meat what would become of the
domestic animalsfowls and geese for instance

fowls and geese would live in freedom like wild birds

now i understand to be sure crows and jackdaws get on all right
without us yes    fowls and geese and hares and sheep all will
live in freedom rejoicing you know and praising god and they will
not fear us peace and concord will come only there is one thing you
know i cant understand zhmuhin went on glancing at the ham how
will it be with the pigs what is to be done with them

they will be like all the restthat is they will live in freedom

ah yes but allow me to say if they were not slaughtered they would
multiply you know and then goodbye to the kitchengardens and the
meadows why a pig if you let it free and dont look after it will
ruin everything in a day a pig is a pig and it is not for nothing it
is called a pig   

they finished supper zhmuhin got up from the table and for a long while
walked up and down the room talking and talking    he was fond of
talking of something important or serious and was fond of meditating
and in his old age he had a longing to reach some haven to be
reassured that he might not be so frightened of dying he had a longing
for meekness spiritual calm and confidence in himself such as this
guest of theirs had who had satisfied his hunger on cucumbers and
bread and believed that doing so made him more perfect he was sitting
on a chest plump and healthy keeping silent and patiently enduring his
boredom and in the dusk when one glanced at him from the entry he
looked like a big round stone which one could not move from its place
if a man has something to lay hold of in life he is all right

zhmuhin went through the entry to the porch and then he could be heard
sighing and saying reflectively to himself yes    to be sure  
  by now it was dark and here and there stars could be seen in the
sky they had not yet lighted up indoors someone came into the parlour
as noiselessly as a shadow and stood still near the door it was lyubov
osipovna zhmuhins wife

are you from the town she asked timidly not looking at her visitor

yes i live in the town

perhaps you are something in the learned way sir be so kind as to
advise us we ought to send in a petition

to whom asked the visitor

we have two sons kind gentleman and they ought to have been sent to
school long ago but we never see anyone and have no one to advise us
and i know nothing for if they are not taught they will have to serve
in the army as common cossacks its not right sir they cant read and
write they are worse than peasants and ivan abramitch himself cant
stand them and wont let them indoors but they are not to blame the
younger one at any rate ought to be sent to school it is such a
pity she said slowly and there was a quiver in her voice and it
seemed incredible that a woman so small and so youthful could have
grownup children oh its such a pity

you dont know anything about it mother and it is not your affair
said zhmuhin appearing in the doorway dont pester our guest with
your wild talk go away mother

lyubov osipovna went out and in the entry repeated once more in a thin
little voice oh its such a pity

a bed was made up for the visitor on the sofa in the parlour and that
it might not be dark for him they lighted the lamp before the ikon
zhmuhin went to bed in his own room and as he lay there he thought of
his soul of his age of his recent stroke which had so frightened him
and made him think of death he was fond of philosophizing when he was
in quietness by himself and then he fancied that he was a very earnest
deep thinker and that nothing in this world interested him but serious
questions and now he kept thinking and he longed to pitch upon some one
significant thought unlike others which would be a guide to him in
life and he wanted to think out principles of some sort for himself so
as to make his life as deep and earnest as he imagined that he felt
himself to be it would be a good thing for an old man like him to
abstain altogether from meat from superfluities of all sorts the time
when men give up killing each other and animals would come sooner or
later it could not but be so and he imagined that time to himself and
clearly pictured himself living in peace with all the animals and
suddenly he thought again of the pigs and everything was in a tangle in
his brain

its a queer business lord have mercy upon us he muttered sighing
heavily are you asleep he asked

no

zhmuhin got out of bed and stopped in the doorway with nothing but his
shirt on displaying to his guest his sinewy legs that looked as dry as
sticks

nowadays you know he began all sorts of telegraphs telephones
and marvels of all kinds in fact have come in but people are no
better than they were they say that in our day thirty or forty years
ago men were coarse and cruel but isnt it just the same now we
certainly did not stand on ceremony in our day i remember in the
caucasus when we were stationed by a little river with nothing to do for
four whole monthsi was an underofficer at that timesomething queer
happened quite in the style of a novel just on the banks of that
river you know where our division was encamped a wretched prince whom
we had killed not long before was buried and at night you know the
princess used to come to his grave and weep she would wail and wail
and moan and moan and make us so depressed we couldnt sleep and
thats the fact we couldnt sleep one night we couldnt sleep a
second well we got sick of it and from a commonsense point of view
you really cant go without your sleep for the devil knows what excuse
the expression we took that princess and gave her a good thrashing
and she gave up coming theres an instance for you nowadays of
course there is not the same class of people and they are not given to
thrashing and they live in cleaner style and there is more learning
but you know the soul is just the same there is no change now look
here theres a landowner living here among us he has mines you know
all sorts of tramps without passports who dont know where to go work
for him on saturdays he has to settle up with the workmen but he
doesnt care to pay them you know he grudges the money so hes got
hold of a foreman who is a tramp too though he does wear a hat dont
you pay them anything he says not a kopeck theyll beat you and
let them beat you says he but you put up with it and ill pay you
ten roubles every saturday for it so on the saturday evening the
workmen come to settle up in the usual way the foreman says to them
nothing well word for word as the master said they begin swearing
and using their fists    they beat him and they kick him    you
know they are a set of men brutalized by hungerthey beat him till he
is senseless and then they go each on his way the master gives orders
for cold water to be poured on the foreman then flings ten roubles in
his face and he takes it and is pleased too for indeed hed be ready
to be hanged for three roubles let alone ten yes    and on monday a
new gang of workmen arrive they work for they have nowhere to go   
 on saturday it is the same story over again

the visitor turned over on the other side with his face to the back of
the sofa and muttered something

and heres another instance zhmuhin went on we had the siberian
plague here you knowthe cattle die off like flies i can tell youand
the veterinary surgeons came here and strict orders were given that the
dead cattle were to be buried at a distance deep in the earth that lime
was to be thrown over them and so on you know on scientific
principles my horse died too i buried it with every precaution and
threw over three hundredweight of lime over it and what do you think
my fine fellowsmy precious sons i meandug it up skinned it and sold
the hide for three roubles theres an instance for you so people have
grown no better and however you feed a wolf he will always look towards
the forest there it is it gives one something to think about eh how
do you look at it

on one side a flash of lightning gleamed through a chink in the window
blinds there was the stifling feeling of a storm coming the gnats were
biting and zhmuhin as he lay in his bedroom meditating sighed and
groaned and said to himself yes to be sure  and there was no
possibility of getting to sleep somewhere far far away there was a
growl of thunder

are you asleep

no answered the visitor

zhmuhin got up and thudding with his heels walked through the parlour
and the entry to the kitchen to get a drink of water

the worst thing in the world you know is stupidity he said a little
later coming back with a dipper my lyubov osipovna is on her knees
saying her prayers she prays every night you know and bows down to
the ground first that her children may be sent to school she is afraid
her boys will go into the army as simple cossacks and that they will be
whacked across their backs with sabres but for teaching one must have
money and where is one to get it you may break the floor beating your
head against it but if you havent got it you havent and the other
reason she prays is because you know every woman imagines there is no
one in the world as unhappy as she is i am a plainspoken man and i
dont want to conceal anything from you she comes of a poor family a
village priests daughter i married her when she was seventeen and
they accepted my offer chiefly because they hadnt enough to eat it was
nothing but poverty and misery while i have anyway land you seea
farmand after all i am an officer it was a step up for her to marry
me you know on the very first day when she was married she cried and
she has been crying ever since all these twenty years she has got a
watery eye and shes always sitting and thinking and what do you
suppose she is thinking about what can a woman think about why
nothing i must own i dont consider a woman a human being

the visitor got up abruptly and sat on the bed

excuse me i feel stifled he said i will go outside

zhmuhin still talking about women drew the bolt in the entry and they
both went out a full moon was floating in the sky just over the yard
and in the moonlight the house and barn looked whiter than by day and
on the grass brilliant streaks of moonlight white too stretched
between the black shadows far away on the right could be seen the
steppe above it the stars were softly glowingand it was all
mysterious infinitely far away as though one were gazing into a deep
abyss while on the left heavy stormclouds black as soot were piling
up one upon another above the steppe their edges were lighted up by the
moon and it looked as though there were mountains there with white snow
on their peaks dark forests the sea there was a flash of lightning a
faint rumble of thunder and it seemed as though a battle were being
fought in the mountains

quite close to the house a little nightowl screeched monotonously

asleep asleep

what time is it now asked the visitor

just after one

how long it is still to dawn

they went back to the house and lay down again it was time to sleep
and one can usually sleep so splendidly before rain but the old man had
a hankering after serious weighty thoughts he wanted not simply to
think but to meditate and he meditated how good it would be as death
was near at hand for the sake of his soul to give up the idleness which
so imperceptibly swallowed up day after day year after year leaving no
trace to think out for himself some great exploitfor instance to walk
on foot far far away or to give up meat like this young man and again
he pictured to himself the time when animals would not be killed
pictured it clearly and distinctly as though he were living through that
time himself but suddenly it was all in a tangle again in his head and
all was muddled

the thunderstorm had passed over but from the edges of the stormclouds
came rain softly pattering on the roof zhmuhin got up stretching and
groaning with old age and looked into the parlour noticing that his
visitor was not asleep he said

when we were in the caucasus you know there was a colonel there who
was a vegetarian too he didnt eat meat never went shooting and
would not let his servants catch fish of course i understand that
every animal ought to live in freedom and enjoy its life only i dont
understand how a pig can go about where it likes without being looked
after   

the visitor got up and sat down his pale haggard face expressed
weariness and vexation it was evident that he was exhausted and only
his gentleness and the delicacy of his soul prevented him from
expressing his vexation in words

its getting light he said mildly please have the horse brought
round for me

why so wait a little and the rain will be over

no i entreat you said the visitor in horror with a supplicating
voice it is essential for me to go at once

and he began hurriedly dressing

by the time the horse was harnessed the sun was rising it had just left
off raining the clouds were racing swiftly by and the patches of blue
were growing bigger and bigger in the sky the first rays of the sun
were timidly reflected below in the big puddles the visitor walked
through the entry with his portfolio to get into the trap and at that
moment zhmuhins wife pale and it seemed paler than the day before
with tearstained eyes looked at him intently without balinking with
the nave expression of a little girl and it was evident from her
dejected face that she was envying him his freedomoh with what joy she
would have gone away from thereand she wanted to say something to him
most likely to ask advice about her children and what a pitiable figure
she was this was not a wife not the head of a house not even a
servant but more like a dependent a poor relation not wanted by
anyone a nonentity     her husband fussing about talking
unceasingly was seeing his visitor off continually running in front of
him while she huddled up to the wall with a timid guilty air waiting
for a convenient minute to speak

please come again another time the old man kept repeating
incessantly what we have we are glad to offer you know

the visitor hurriedly got into the trap evidently with relief as
though he were afraid every minute that they would detain him the trap
lurched about as it had the day before squeaked and furiously rattled
the pail that was tied on at the back he glanced round at zhmuhin with
a peculiar expression it looked as though he wanted to call him a
petchenyeg as the surveyor had once done or some such name but his
gentleness got the upper hand he controlled himself and said nothing
but in the gateway he suddenly could not restrain himself he got up and
shouted loudly and angrily

you have bored me to death

and he disappeared through the gate

near the barn zhmuhins sons were standing the elder held a gun while
the younger had in his hands a grey cockerel with a bright red comb the
younger flung up the cockerel with all his might the bird flew upwards
higher than the house and turned over in the air like a pigeon the
elder boy fired and the cockerel fell like a stone

the old man overcome with confusion not knowing how to explain the
visitors strange unexpected shout went slowly back into the house
and sitting down at the table he spent a long while meditating on the
intellectual tendencies of the day on the universal immorality on the
telegraph on the telephone on velocipedes on how unnecessary it all
was little by little he regained his composure then slowly had a meal
drank five glasses of tea and lay down for a nap
