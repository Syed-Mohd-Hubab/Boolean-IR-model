at the barbers

morning it is not yet seven oclock but makar kuzmitch blyostkens
shop is already open the barber himself an unwashed greasy but
foppishly dressed youth of three and twenty is busy clearing up there
is really nothing to be cleared away but he is perspiring with his
exertions in one place he polishes with a rag in another he scrapes
with his finger or catches a bug and brushes it off the wall

the barbers shop is small narrow and unclean the log walls are hung
with paper suggestive of a cabmans faded shirt between the two dingy
perspiring windows there is a thin creaking rickety door above it
green from the damp a bell which trembles and gives a sickly ring of
itself without provocation glance into the looking glass which hangs on
one of the walls and it distorts your countenance in all directions in
the most merciless way the shaving and haircutting is done before this
looking glass on the little table as greasy and unwashed as makar
kuzmitch himself there is everything combs scissors razors a
haporth of wax for the moustache a haporth of powder a haporth of
much watered eau de cologne and indeed the whole barbers shop is not
worth more than fifteen kopecks

there is a squeaking sound from the invalid bell and an elderly man in a
tanned sheepskin and high felt over boots walks into the shop his head
and neck are wrapped in a womans shawl

this is erast ivanitch yagodov makar kuzmitchs godfather at one time
he served as a watchman in the consistory now he lives near the red
pond and works as a locksmith

makarushka good day dear boy he says to makar kuzmitch who is
absorbed in tidying up

they kiss each other yagodov drags his shawl off his head crosses
himself and sits down

what a long way it is he says sighing and clearing his throat its
no joke from the red pond to the kaluga gate

how are you

in a poor way my boy ive had a fever

you dont say so fever

yes i have been in bed a month i thought i should die i had extreme
unction now my hairs coming out the doctor says i must be shaved he
says the hair will grow again strong and so i thought ill go to
makar better to a relation than to anyone else he will do it better
and he wont take anything for it its rather far thats true but
what of it its a walk

ill do it with pleasure please sit down

with a scrape of his foot makar kuzmitch indicates a chair yagodov sits
down and looks at himself in the glass and is apparently pleased with
his reflection the looking glass displays a face awry with kalmuck
lips a broad blunt nose and eyes in the forehead makar kuzmitch puts
round his clients shoulders a white sheet with yellow spots on it and
begins snipping with the scissors

ill shave you clean to the skin he says

to be sure so that i may look like a tartar like a bomb the hair
will grow all the thicker

hows auntie

pretty middling the other day she went as midwife to the majors lady
they gave her a rouble

oh indeed a rouble hold your ear

i am holding it    mind you dont cut me oy you hurt you are
pulling my hair

that doesnt matter we cant help that in our work and how is anna
erastovna

my daughter she is all right shes skipping about last week on the
wednesday we betrothed her to sheikin why didnt you come

the scissors cease snipping makar kuzmitch drops his hands and asks in
a fright

who is betrothed

anna

hows that to whom

to sheikin prokofy petrovitch his aunts a housekeeper in
zlatoustensky lane she is a nice woman naturally we are all delighted
thank god the wedding will be in a week mind you come we will have a
good time

but hows this erast ivanitch says makar kuzmitch pale astonished
and shrugging his shoulders its    its utterly impossible why
anna erastovna    why i    why i cherished sentiments for her i
had intentions how could it happen

why we just went and betrothed her hes a good fellow

cold drops of perspiration come on the face of makar kuzmitch he puts
the scissors down on the table and begins rubbing his nose with his
fist

i had intentions he says its impossible erast ivanitch i    i
am in love with her and have made her the offer of my heart     and
auntie promised i have always respected you as though you were my
father    i always cut your hair for nothing    i have always
obliged you and when my papa died you took the sofa and ten roubles in
cash and have never given them back do you remember

remember of course i do only what sort of a match would you be
makar you are nothing of a match youve neither money nor position
your trades a paltry one

and is sheikin rich

sheikin is a member of a union he has a thousand and a half lent on
mortgage so my boy     its no good talking about it the things
done there is no altering it makarushka you must look out for another
bride    the world is not so small come cut away why are you
stopping

makar kuzmitch is silent and remains motionless then he takes a
handkerchief out of his pocket and begins to cry

come what is it erast ivanitch comforts him give over fie he is
blubbering like a woman you finish my head and then cry take up the
scissors

makar kuzmitch takes up the scissors stares vacantly at them for a
minute then drops them again on the table his hands are shaking

i cant he says i cant do it just now i havent the strength i
am a miserable man and she is miserable we loved each other we had
given each other our promise and we have been separated by unkind people
without any pity go away erast ivanitch i cant bear the sight of
you

so ill come to morrow makarushka you will finish me to morrow

right

you calm yourself and i will come to you early in the morning

erast ivanitch has half his head shaven to the skin and looks like a
convict it is awkward to be left with a head like that but there is no
help for it he wraps his head in the shawl and walks out of the
barbers shop left alone makar kuzmitch sits down and goes on quietly
weeping

early next morning erast ivanitch comes again

what do you want makar kuzmitch asks him coldly

finish cutting my hair makarushka there is half the head left to do

kindly give me the money in advance i wont cut it for nothing

without saying a word erast ivanitch goes out and to this day his hair
is long on one side of the head and short on the other he regards it as
extravagance to pay for having his hair cut and is waiting for the hair
to grow of itself on the shaven side

he danced at the wedding in that condition
