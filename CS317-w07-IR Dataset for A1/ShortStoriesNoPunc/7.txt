old age

uzelkov an architect with the rank of civil councillor arrived in his
native town to which he had been invited to restore the church in the
cemetery he had been born in the town had been at school had grown up
and married in it but when he got out of the train he scarcely
recognized it everything was changed    eighteen years ago when he
had moved to petersburg the street boys used to catch marmots for
instance on the spot where now the station was standing now when one
drove into the chief street a hotel of four storeys stood facing one
in old days there was an ugly grey fence just there but nothingneither
fences nor houseshad changed as much as the people from his enquiries
of the hotel waiter uzelkov learned that more than half of the people he
remembered were dead reduced to poverty forgotten

and do you remember uzelkov he asked the old waiter about himself
uzelkov the architect who divorced his wife he used to have a house in
svirebeyevsky street    you must remember

i dont remember sir

how is it you dont remember the case made a lot of noise even the
cabmen all knew about it think now shapkin the attorney managed my
divorce for me the rascal    the notorious cardsharper the fellow
who got a thrashing at the club   

ivan nikolaitch

yes yes    well is he alive is he dead

alive sir thank god he is a notary now and has an office he is very
well off he has two houses in kirpitchny street    his daughter was
married the other day

uzelkov paced up and down the room thought a bit and in his boredom
made up his mind to go and see shapkin at his office when he walked out
of the hotel and sauntered slowly towards kirpitchny street it was
midday he found shapkin at his office and scarcely recognized him from
the once well made adroit attorney with a mobile insolent and always
drunken face shapkin had changed into a modest grey headed decrepit
old man

you dont recognize me you have forgotten me began uzelkov i am
your old client uzelkov

uzelkov what uzelkov ah shapkin remembered recognized and was
struck all of a heap there followed a shower of exclamations
questions recollections

this is a surprise this is unexpected cackled shapkin what can i
offer you do you care for champagne perhaps you would like oysters my
dear fellow i have had so much from you in my time that i cant offer
you anything equal to the occasion   

please dont put yourself out    said uzelkov i have no time to
spare i must go at once to the cemetery and examine the church i have
undertaken the restoration of it

thats capital well have a snack and a drink and drive together i
have capital horses ill take you there and introduce you to the
church warden i will arrange it all    but why is it my angel you
seem to be afraid of me and hold me at arms length sit a little
nearer there is no need for you to be afraid of me nowadays he he  
 at one time it is true i was a cunning blade a dog of a fellow  
 no one dared approach me but now i am stiller than water and humbler
than the grass i have grown old i am a family man i have children
its time i was dead

the friends had lunch had a drink and with a pair of horses drove out
of the town to the cemetery

yes those were times shapkin recalled as he sat in the sledge when
you remember them you simply cant believe in them do you remember how
you divorced your wife its nearly twenty years ago and i dare say you
have forgotten it all but i remember it as though id divorced you
yesterday good lord what a lot of worry i had over it i was a sharp
fellow tricky and cunning a desperate character    sometimes i was
burning to tackle some ticklish business especially if the fee were a
good one as for instance in your case what did you pay me then five
or six thousand that was worth taking trouble for wasnt it you went
off to petersburg and left the whole thing in my hands to do the best i
could and though sofya mihailovna your wife came only of a merchant
family she was proud and dignified to bribe her to take the guilt on
herself was difficult awfully difficult i would go to negotiate with
her and as soon as she saw me she called to her maid masha didnt i
tell you not to admit that scoundrel well i tried one thing and
another    i wrote her letters and contrived to meet her
accidentallyit was no use i had to act through a third person i had a
lot of trouble with her for a long time and she only gave in when you
agreed to give her ten thousand    she couldnt resist ten thousand
she couldnt hold out    she cried she spat in my face but she
consented she took the guilt on herself

i thought it was fifteen thousand she had from me not ten said
uzelkov

yes yes    fifteeni made a mistake said shapkin in confusion
its all over and done with though its no use concealing it i gave
her ten and the other five i collared for myself i deceived you both 
  its all over and done with its no use to be ashamed and indeed
judge for yourself boris petrovitch werent you the very person for me
to get money out of    you were a wealthy man and had everything you
wanted    your marriage was an idle whim and so was your divorce
you were making a lot of money    i remember you made a scoop of
twenty thousand over one contract whom should i have fleeced if not
you and i must own i envied you if you grabbed anything they took off
their caps to you while they would thrash me for a rouble and slap me
in the face at the club    but there why recall it it is high time
to forget it

tell me please how did sofya mihailovna get on afterwards

with her ten thousand very badly god knows what it wasshe lost her
head perhaps or maybe her pride and her conscience tormented her at
having sold her honour or perhaps she loved you but do you know she
took to drink    as soon as she got her money she was off driving
about with officers it was drunkenness dissipation debauchery   
when she went to a restaurant with officers she was not content with
port or anything light she must have strong brandy fiery stuff to
stupefy her

yes she was eccentric    i had a lot to put up with from her   
sometimes she would take offence at something and begin being
hysterical    and what happened afterwards

one week passed and then another    i was sitting at home writing
something all at once the door opened and she walked in    drunk
take back your cursed money she said and flung a roll of notes in my
face    so she could not keep it up i picked up the notes and
counted them it was five hundred short of the ten thousand so she had
only managed to get through five hundred

where did you put the money

its all ancient history    theres no reason to conceal it now  
 in my pocket of course why do you look at me like that wait a bit
for what will come later    its a regular novel a pathological
study a couple of months later i was going home one night in a nasty
drunken condition    i lighted a candle and lo and behold sofya
mihailovna was sitting on my sofa and she was drunk too and in a
frantic stateas wild as though she had run out of bedlam give me back
my money she said i have changed my mind if i must go to ruin i
wont do it by halves ill have my fling be quick you scoundrel give
me my money a disgraceful scene

and you    gave it her

i gave her i remember ten roubles

oh how could you cried uzelkov frowning if you couldnt or
wouldnt have given it her you might have written to me    and i
didnt know i didnt know

my dear fellow what use would it have been for me to write
considering that she wrote to you herself when she was lying in the
hospital afterwards

yes but i was so taken up then with my second marriage i was in such
a whirl that i had no thoughts to spare for letters    but you were
an outsider you had no antipathy for sofya   why didnt you give her
a helping hand   

you cant judge by the standards of to day boris petrovitch thats
how we look at it now but at the time we thought very differently  
 now maybe id give her a thousand roubles but then even that ten 
rouble note i did not give her for nothing it was a bad business   
we must forget it    but here we are   

the sledge stopped at the cemetery gates uzelkov and shapkin got out of
the sledge went in at the gate and walked up a long broad avenue the
bare cherry trees and acacias the grey crosses and tombstones were
silvered with hoar frost every little grain of snow reflected the
bright sunny day there was the smell there always is in cemeteries
the smell of incense and freshly dug earth   

our cemetery is a pretty one said uzelkov quite a garden

yes but it is a pity thieves steal the tombstones    and over
there beyond that iron monument on the right sofya mihailovna is
buried would you like to see

the friends turned to the right and walked through the deep snow to the
iron monument

here it is said shapkin pointing to a little slab of white marble
a lieutenant put the stone on her grave

uzelkov slowly took off his cap and exposed his bald head to the sun
shapkin looking at him took off his cap too and another bald patch
gleamed in the sunlight there was the stillness of the tomb all around
as though the air too were dead the friends looked at the grave
pondered and said nothing

she sleeps in peace said shapkin breaking the silence its nothing
to her now that she took the blame on herself and drank brandy you must
own boris petrovitch    

own what uzelkov asked gloomily

why    however hateful the past it was better than this

and shapkin pointed to his grey head

i used not to think of the hour of death    i fancied i could have
given death points and won the game if we had had an encounter but now
   but whats the good of talking

uzelkov was overcome with melancholy he suddenly had a passionate
longing to weep as once he had longed for love and he felt those tears
would have tasted sweet and refreshing a moisture came into his eyes
and there was a lump in his throat but    shapkin was standing
beside him and uzelkov was ashamed to show weakness before a witness he
turned back abruptly and went into the church

only two hours later after talking to the churchwarden and looking over
the church he seized a moment when shapkin was in conversation with the
priest and hastened away to weep    he stole up to the grave
secretly furtively looking round him every minute the little white
slab looked at him pensively mournfully and innocently as though a
little girl lay under it instead of a dissolute divorced wife

to weep to weep thought uzelkov

but the moment for tears had been missed though the old man balinked
his eyes though he worked up his feelings the tears did not flow nor
the lump come in his throat after standing for ten minutes with a
gesture of despair uzelkov went to look for shapkin
