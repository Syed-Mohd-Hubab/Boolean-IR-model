in trouble

pyotr semyonitch the bank manager together with the book keeper his
assistant and two members of the board were taken in the night to
prison the day after the upheaval the merchant avdeyev who was one of
the committee of auditors was sitting with his friends in the shop
saying

so it is gods will it seems there is no escaping your fate here to 
day we are eating caviare and to morrow for aught we know it will be
prison beggary or maybe death anything may happen take pyotr
semyonitch for instance   

he spoke screwing up his drunken eyes while his friends went on
drinking eating caviare and listening having described the disgrace
and helplessness of pyotr semyonitch who only the day before had been
powerful and respected by all avdeyev went on with a sigh

the tears of the mouse come back to the cat serve them right the
scoundrels they could steal the rooks so let them answer for it

youd better look out ivan danilitch that you dont catch it too
one of his friends observed

what has it to do with me

why they were stealing and what were you auditors thinking about
ill be bound you signed the audit

its all very well to talk laughed avdeyev signed it indeed they
used to bring the accounts to my shop and i signed them as though i
understood give me anything you like ill scrawl my name to it if you
were to write that i murdered someone id sign my name to it i havent
time to go into it besides i cant see without my spectacles

after discussing the failure of the bank and the fate of pyotr
semyonitch avdeyev and his friends went to eat pie at the house of a
friend whose wife was celebrating her name day at the name day party
everyone was discussing the bank failure avdeyev was more excited than
anyone and declared that he had long foreseen the crash and knew two
years before that things were not quite right at the bank while they
were eating pie he described a dozen illegal operations which had come
to his knowledge

if you knew why did you not give information asked an officer who
was present

i wasnt the only one the whole town knew of it laughed avdeyev
besides i havent the time to hang about the law courts damn them

he had a nap after the pie and then had dinner then had another nap
then went to the evening service at the church of which he was a warden
after the service he went back to the name day party and played
preference till midnight everything seemed satisfactory

but when avdeyev hurried home after midnight the cook who opened the
door to him looked pale and was trembling so violently that she could
not utter a word his wife elizaveta trofimovna a flabby overfed
woman with her grey hair hanging loose was sitting on the sofa in the
drawing room quivering all over and vacantly rolling her eyes as though
she were drunk her elder son vassily a high school boy pale too and
extremely agitated was fussing round her with a glass of water

whats the matter asked avdeyev and looked angrily sideways at the
stove his family was constantly being upset by the fumes from it

the examining magistrate has just been with the police answered
vassily theyve made a search

avdeyev looked round him the cupboards the chests the
tables everything bore traces of the recent search for a minute avdeyev
stood motionless as though petrified unable to understand then his
whole inside quivered and seemed to grow heavy his left leg went numb
and unable to endure his trembling he lay down flat on the sofa he
felt his inside heaving and his rebellious left leg tapping against the
back of the sofa

in the course of two or three minutes he recalled the whole of his past
but could not remember any crime deserving of the attention of the
police

its all nonsense he said getting up they must have slandered me
to morrow i must lodge a complaint of their having dared to do such a
thing

next morning after a sleepless night avdeyev as usual went to his
shop his customers brought him the news that during the night the
public prosecutor had sent the deputy manager and the head clerk to
prison as well this news did not disturb avdeyev he was convinced that
he had been slandered and that if he were to lodge a complaint to day
the examining magistrate would get into trouble for the search of the
night before

between nine and ten oclock he hurried to the town hall to see the
secretary who was the only educated man in the town council

vladimir stepanitch whats this new fashion he said bending down to
the secretarys ear people have been stealing but how do i come in
what has it to do with me my dear fellow he whispered there has
been a search at my house last night upon my word have they gone
crazy why touch me

because one shouldnt be a sheep the secretary answered calmly
before you sign you ought to look

look at what but if i were to look at those accounts for a thousand
years i could not make head or tail of them its all greek to me i am
no book keeper they used to bring them to me and i signed them

excuse me apart from that you and your committee are seriously
compromised you borrowed nineteen thousand from the bank giving no
security

lord have mercy upon us cried avdeyev in amazement i am not the
only one in debt to the bank the whole town owes it money i pay the
interest and i shall repay the debt what next and besides to tell the
honest truth it wasnt i myself borrowed the money pyotr semyonitch
forced it upon me take it he said take it if you dont take it
he said it means that you dont trust us and fight shy of us you take
it he said and build your father a mill so i took it

well you see none but children or sheep can reason like that in any
case signor you need not be anxious you cant escape trial of
course but you are sure to be acquitted

the secretarys indifference and calm tone restored avdeyevs composure
going back to his shop and finding friends there he again began
drinking eating caviare and airing his views he almost forgot the
police search and he was only troubled by one circumstance which he
could not help noticing his left leg was strangely numb and his
stomach for some reason refused to do its work

that evening destiny dealt another overwhelming blow at avdeyev at an
extraordinary meeting of the town council all members who were on the
staff of the bank avdeyev among them were asked to resign on the
ground that they were charged with a criminal offence in the morning he
received a request to give up immediately his duties as churchwarden

after that avdeyev lost count of the blows dealt him by fate and
strange unprecedented days flitted rapidly by one after another and
every day brought some new unexpected surprise among other things the
examining magistrate sent him a summons and he returned home after the
interview insulted and red in the face

he gave me no peace pestering me to tell him why i had signed i
signed thats all about it i didnt do it on purpose they brought the
papers to the shop and i signed them i am no great hand at reading
writing

young men with unconcerned faces arrived sealed up the shop and made
an inventory of all the furniture of the house suspecting some intrigue
behind this and as before unconscious of any wrongdoing avdeyev in
his mortification ran from one government office to another lodging
complaints he spent hours together in waiting rooms composed long
petitions shed tears swore to his complaints the public prosecutor
and the examining magistrate made the indifferent and rational reply
come to us when you are summoned we have not time to attend to you
now while others answered it is not our business

the secretary an educated man who avdeyev thought might have helped
him merely shrugged his shoulders and said

its your own fault you shouldnt have been a sheep

the old man exerted himself to the utmost but his left leg was still
numb and his digestion was getting worse and worse when he was weary
of doing nothing and was getting poorer and poorer he made up his mind
to go to his fathers mill or to his brother and begin dealing in
corn his family went to his fathers and he was left alone the days
flitted by one after another without a family without a shop and
without money the former churchwarden an honoured and respected man
spent whole days going the round of his friends shops drinking
eating and listening to advice in the mornings and in the evenings to
while away the time he went to church looking for hours together at
the ikons he did not pray but pondered his conscience was clear and
he ascribed his position to mistake and misunderstanding to his mind
it was all due to the fact that the officials and the examining
magistrates were young men and inexperienced it seemed to him that if
he were to talk it over in detail and open his heart to some elderly
judge everything would go right again he did not understand his
judges and he fancied they did not understand him

the days raced by and at last after protracted harassing delays the
day of the trial came avdeyev borrowed fifty roubles and providing
himself with spirit to rub on his leg and a decoction of herbs for his
digestion set off for the town where the circuit court was being held

the trial lasted for ten days throughout the trial avdeyev sat among
his companions in misfortune with the stolid composure and dignity
befitting a respectable and innocent man who is suffering for no fault
of his own he listened and did not understand a word he was in an
antagonistic mood he was angry at being detained so long in the court
at being unable to get lenten food anywhere at his defending counsels
not understanding him and as he thought saying the wrong thing he
thought that the judges did not understand their business they took
scarcely any notice of avdeyev they only addressed him once in three
days and the questions they put to him were of such a character that
avdeyev raised a laugh in the audience each time he answered them when
he tried to speak of the expenses he had incurred of his losses and of
his meaning to claim his costs from the court his counsel turned round
and made an incomprehensible grimace the public laughed and the judge
announced sternly that that had nothing to do with the case the last
words that he was allowed to say were not what his counsel had
instructed him to say but something quite different which raised a
laugh again

during the terrible hour when the jury were consulting in their room he
sat angrily in the refreshment bar not thinking about the jury at all
he did not understand why they were so long deliberating when everything
was so clear and what they wanted of him

getting hungry he asked the waiter to give him some cheap lenten dish
for forty kopecks they gave him some cold fish and carrots he ate it
and felt at once as though the fish were heaving in a chilly lump in his
stomach it was followed by flatulence heartburn and pain

afterwards as he listened to the foreman of the jury reading out the
questions point by point there was a regular revolution taking place in
his inside his whole body was bathed in a cold sweat his left leg was
numb he did not follow understood nothing and suffered unbearably at
not being able to sit or lie down while the foreman was reading at
last when he and his companions were allowed to sit down the public
prosecutor got up and said something unintelligible and all at once as
though they had sprung out of the earth some police officers appeared
on the scene with drawn swords and surrounded all the prisoners avdeyev
was told to get up and go

now he understood that he was found guilty and in charge of the police
but he was not frightened nor amazed such a turmoil was going on in his
stomach that he could not think about his guards

so they wont let us go back to the hotel he asked one of his
companions but i have three roubles and an untouched quarter of a
pound of tea in my room there

he spent the night at the police station all night he was aware of a
loathing for fish and was thinking about the three roubles and the
quarter of a pound of tea early in the morning when the sky was
beginning to turn blue he was told to dress and set off two soldiers
with bayonets took him to prison never before had the streets of the
town seemed to him so long and endless he walked not on the pavement
but in the middle of the road in the muddy thawing snow his inside was
still at war with the fish his left leg was numb he had forgotten his
goloshes either in the court or in the police station and his feet felt
frozen

five days later all the prisoners were brought before the court again to
hear their sentence avdeyev learnt that he was sentenced to exile in
the province of tobolsk and that did not frighten nor amaze him either
he fancied for some reason that the trial was not yet over that there
were more adjournments to come and that the final decision had not been
reached yet    he went on in the prison expecting this final
decision every day

only six months later when his wife and his son vassily came to say
good bye to him and when in the wasted wretchedly dressed old woman he
scarcely recognized his once fat and dignified elizaveta trofimovna and
when he saw his son wearing a short shabby reefer jacket and cotton
trousers instead of the high school uniform he realized that his fate
was decided and that whatever new decision there might be his past
would never come back to him and for the first time since the trial and
his imprisonment the angry expression left his face and he wept
bitterly
