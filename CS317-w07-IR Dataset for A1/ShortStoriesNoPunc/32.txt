the marshals widow

on the first of february every year st trifons day there is an
extraordinary commotion on the estate of madame zavzyatov the widow of
trifon lvovitch the late marshal of the district on that day the
nameday of the deceased marshal the widow lyubov petrovna has a requiem
service celebrated in his memory and after the requiem a thanksgiving
to the lord the whole district assembles for the service there you
will see hrumov the present marshal marfutkin the president of the
zemstvo potrashkov the permanent member of the rural board the two
justices of the peace of the district the police captain krinolinov
two police superintendents the district doctor dvornyagin smelling of
iodoform all the landowners great and small and so on there are
about fifty people assembled in all

precisely at twelve oclock the visitors with long faces make their
way from all the rooms to the big hall there are carpets on the floor
and their steps are noiseless but the solemnity of the occasion makes
them instinctively walk on tip toe holding out their hands to balance
themselves in the hall everything is already prepared father yevmeny
a little old man in a high faded cap puts on his black vestments
konkordiev the deacon already in his vestments and as red as a crab
is noiselessly turning over the leaves of his missal and putting slips
of paper in it at the door leading to the vestibule luka the
sacristan puffing out his cheeks and making round eyes blows up the
censer the hall is gradually filled with bluish transparent smoke and
the smell of incense

gelikonsky the elementary schoolmaster a young man with big pimples on
his frightened face wearing a new greatcoat like a sack carries round
wax candles on a silver plated tray the hostess lyubov petrovna
stands in the front by a little table with a dish of funeral rice on it
and holds her handkerchief in readiness to her face there is a profound
stillness broken from time to time by sighs everybody has a long
solemn face   

the requiem service begins the blue smoke curls up from the censer and
plays in the slanting sunbeams the lighted candles faintly splutter
the singing at first harsh and deafening soon becomes quiet and
musical as the choir gradually adapt themselves to the acoustic
conditions of the rooms    the tunes are all mournful and sad   
the guests are gradually brought to a melancholy mood and grow pensive
thoughts of the brevity of human life of mutability of worldly vanity
stray through their brains    they recall the deceased zavzyatov a
thick set red cheeked man who used to drink off a bottle of champagne
at one gulp and smash looking glasses with his forehead and when they
sing with thy saints o lord and the sobs of their hostess are
audible the guests shift uneasily from one foot to the other the more
emotional begin to feel a tickling in their throat and about their
eyelids marfutkin the president of the zemstvo to stifle the
unpleasant feeling bends down to the police captains ear and whispers

i was at ivan fyodoritchs yesterday    pyotr petrovitch and i took
all the tricks playing no trumps    yes indeed    olga
andreyevna was so exasperated that her false tooth fell out of her
mouth

but at last the eternal memory is sung gelikonsky respectfully takes
away the candles and the memorial service is over thereupon there
follows a momentary commotion there is a changing of vestments and a
thanksgiving service after the thanksgiving while father yevmeny is
disrobing the visitors rub their hands and cough while their hostess
tells some anecdote of the good heartedness of the deceased trifon
lvovitch

pray come to lunch friends she says concluding her story with a
sigh

the visitors trying not to push or tread on each others feet hasten
into the dining room    there the luncheon is awaiting them the
repast is so magnificent that the deacon konkordiev thinks it his duty
every year to fling up his hands as he looks at it and shaking his head
in amazement say

supernatural its not so much like human fare father yevmeny as
offerings to the gods

the lunch is certainly exceptional everything that the flora and fauna
of the country can furnish is on the table but the only thing
supernatural about it perhaps is that on the table there is everything
except    alcoholic beverages lyubov petrovna has taken a vow never
to have in her house cards or spirituous liquors  the two sources of her
husbands ruin and the only bottles contain oil and vinegar as though
in mockery and chastisement of the guests who are to a man desperately
fond of the bottle and given to tippling

please help yourselves gentlemen the marshals widow presses them
only you must excuse me i have no vodka    i have none in the
house

the guests approach the table and hesitatingly attack the pie but the
progress with eating is slow in the plying of forks in the cutting up
and munching there is a certain sloth and apathy    evidently
something is wanting

i feel as though i had lost something one of the justices of the
peace whispers to the other i feel as i did when my wife ran away with
the engineer    i cant eat

marfutkin before beginning to eat fumbles for a long time in his
pocket and looks for his handkerchief

oh my handkerchief must be in my greatcoat he recalls in a loud
voice and here i am looking for it and he goes into the vestibule
where the fur coats are hanging up

he returns from the vestibule with glistening eyes and at once attacks
the pie with relish

i say its horrid munching away with a dry mouth isnt it he
whispers to father yevmeny go into the vestibule father theres a
bottle there in my fur coat    only mind you are careful dont make
a clatter with the bottle

father yevmeny recollects that he has some direction to give to luka
and trips off to the vestibule

father a couple of words in confidence says dvornyagin overtaking
him

you should see the fur coat ive bought myself gentlemen hrumov
boasts its worth a thousand and i gave    you wont believe it 
  two hundred and fifty not a farthing more

at any other time the guests would have greeted this information with
indifference but now they display surprise and incredulity in the end
they all troop out into the vestibule to look at the fur coat and go on
looking at it till the doctors man mikeshka carries five empty bottles
out on the sly when the steamed sturgeon is served marfutkin remembers
that he has left his cigar case in his sledge and goes to the stable
that he may not be lonely on this expedition he takes with him the
deacon who appropriately feels it necessary to have a look at his
horse   

on the evening of the same day lyubov petrovna is sitting in her study
writing a letter to an old friend in petersburg

to day as in past years she writes among other things i had a
memorial service for my dear husband all my neighbours came to the
service they are a simple rough set but what hearts i gave them a
splendid lunch but of course as in previous years without a drop of
alcoholic liquor ever since he died from excessive drinking i have
vowed to establish temperance in this district and thereby to expiate
his sins i have begun the campaign for temperance at my own house
father yevmeny is delighted with my efforts and helps me both in word
and deed oh ma chre if you knew how fond my bears are of me the
president of the zemstvo marfutkin kissed my hand after lunch held it
a long while to his lips and wagging his head in an absurd way burst
into tears so much feeling but no words father yevmeny that
delightful little old man sat down by me and looking tearfully at me
kept babbling something like a child i did not understand what he said
but i know how to understand true feeling the police captain the
handsome man of whom i wrote to you went down on his knees to me tried
to read me some verses of his own composition he is a poet but   
his feelings were too much for him he lurched and fell over    that
huge giant went into hysterics you can imagine my delight the day did
not pass without a hitch however poor alalykin the president of the
judges assembly a stout and apoplectic man was overcome by illness
and lay on the sofa in a state of unconsciousness for two hours we had
to pour water on him    i am thankful to doctor dvornyagin he had
brought a bottle of brandy from his dispensary and he moistened the
patients temples which quickly revived him and he was able to be
moved
