a story without a title

in the fifth century just as now the sun rose every morning and every
evening retired to rest in the morning when the first rays kissed the
dew the earth revived the air was filled with the sounds of rapture
and hope while in the evening the same earth subsided into silence and
plunged into gloomy darkness one day was like another one night like
another from time to time a storm cloud raced up and there was the
angry rumble of thunder or a negligent star fell out of the sky or a
pale monk ran to tell the brotherhood that not far from the monastery he
had seen a tigerand that was all and then each day was like the next

the monks worked and prayed and their father superior played on the
organ made latin verses and wrote music the wonderful old man
possessed an extraordinary gift he played on the organ with such art
that even the oldest monks whose hearing had grown somewhat dull
towards the end of their lives could not restrain their tears when the
sounds of the organ floated from his cell when he spoke of anything
even of the most ordinary thingsfor instance of the trees of the wild
beasts or of the seathey could not listen to him without a smile or
tears and it seemed that the same chords vibrated in his soul as in the
organ if he were moved to anger or abandoned himself to intense joy or
began speaking of something terrible or grand then a passionate
inspiration took possession of him tears came into his flashing eyes
his face flushed and his voice thundered and as the monks listened to
him they felt that their souls were spell bound by his inspiration at
such marvellous splendid moments his power over them was boundless and
if he had bidden his elders fling themselves into the sea they would
all every one of them have hastened to carry out his wishes

his music his voice his poetry in which he glorified god the heavens
and the earth were a continual source of joy to the monks it sometimes
happened that through the monotony of their lives they grew weary of the
trees the flowers the spring the autumn their ears were tired of the
sound of the sea and the song of the birds seemed tedious to them but
the talents of their father superior were as necessary to them as their
daily bread

dozens of years passed by and every day was like every other day every
night was like every other night except the birds and the wild beasts
not one soul appeared near the monastery the nearest human habitation
was far away and to reach it from the monastery or to reach the
monastery from it meant a journey of over seventy miles across the
desert only men who despised life who had renounced it and who came
to the monastery as to the grave ventured to cross the desert

what was the amazement of the monks therefore when one night there
knocked at their gate a man who turned out to be from the town and the
most ordinary sinner who loved life before saying his prayers and
asking for the father superiors blessing this man asked for wine and
food to the question how he had come from the town into the desert he
answered by a long story of hunting he had gone out hunting had drunk
too much and lost his way to the suggestion that he should enter the
monastery and save his soul he replied with a smile i am not a fit
companion for you

when he had eaten and drunk he looked at the monks who were serving him
shook his head reproachfully and said

you dont do anything you monks you are good for nothing but eating
and drinking is that the way to save ones soul only think while you
sit here in peace eat and drink and dream of beatitude your neighbours
are perishing and going to hell you should see what is going on in the
town some are dying of hunger others not knowing what to do with
their gold sink into profligacy and perish like flies stuck in honey
there is no faith no truth in men whose task is it to save them whose
work is it to preach to them it is not for me drunk from morning till
night as i am can a meek spirit a loving heart and faith in god have
been given you for you to sit here within four walls doing nothing

the townsmans drunken words were insolent and unseemly but they had a
strange effect upon the father superior the old man exchanged glances
with his monks turned pale and said

my brothers he speaks the truth you know indeed poor people in
their weakness and lack of understanding are perishing in vice and
infidelity while we do not move as though it did not concern us why
should i not go and remind them of the christ whom they have forgotten

the townsmans words had carried the old man away the next day he took
his staff said farewell to the brotherhood and set off for the town
and the monks were left without music and without his speeches and
verses they spent a month drearily then a second but the old man did
not come back at last after three months had passed the familiar tap of
his staff was heard the monks flew to meet him and showered questions
upon him but instead of being delighted to see them he wept bitterly
and did not utter a word the monks noticed that he looked greatly aged
and had grown thinner his face looked exhausted and wore an expression
of profound sadness and when he wept he had the air of a man who has
been outraged

the monks fell to weeping too and began with sympathy asking him why he
was weeping why his face was so gloomy but he locked himself in his
cell without uttering a word for seven days he sat in his cell eating
and drinking nothing weeping and not playing on his organ to knocking
at his door and to the entreaties of the monks to come out and share his
grief with them he replied with unbroken silence

at last he came out gathering all the monks around him with a tear 
stained face and with an expression of grief and indignation he began
telling them of what had befallen him during those three months his
voice was calm and his eyes were smiling while he described his journey
from the monastery to the town on the road he told them the birds
sang to him the brooks gurgled and sweet youthful hopes agitated his
soul he marched on and felt like a soldier going to battle and
confident of victory he walked on dreaming and composed poems and
hymns and reached the end of his journey without noticing it

but his voice quivered his eyes flashed and he was full of wrath when
he came to speak of the town and of the men in it never in his life had
he seen or even dared to imagine what he met with when he went into the
town only then for the first time in his life in his old age he saw
and understood how powerful was the devil how fair was evil and how
weak and faint hearted and worthless were men by an unhappy chance the
first dwelling he entered was the abode of vice some fifty men in
possession of much money were eating and drinking wine beyond measure
intoxicated by the wine they sang songs and boldly uttered terrible
revolting words such as a god fearing man could not bring himself to
pronounce boundlessly free self confident and happy they feared
neither god nor the devil nor death but said and did what they liked
and went whither their lust led them and the wine clear as amber
flecked with sparks of gold must have been irresistibly sweet and
fragrant for each man who drank it smiled blissfully and wanted to
drink more to the smile of man it responded with a smile and sparkled
joyfully when they drank it as though it knew the devilish charm it
kept hidden in its sweetness

the old man growing more and more incensed and weeping with wrath went
on to describe what he had seen on a table in the midst of the
revellers he said stood a sinful half naked woman it was hard to
imagine or to find in nature anything more lovely and fascinating this
reptile young longhaired dark skinned with black eyes and full lips
shameless and insolent showed her snow white teeth and smiled as though
to say look how shameless how beautiful i am silk and brocade fell
in lovely folds from her shoulders but her beauty would not hide itself
under her clothes but eagerly thrust itself through the folds like the
young grass through the ground in spring the shameless woman drank
wine sang songs and abandoned herself to anyone who wanted her

then the old man wrathfully brandishing his arms described the horse 
races the bull fights the theatres the artists studios where they
painted naked women or moulded them of clay he spoke with inspiration
with sonorous beauty as though he were playing on unseen chords while
the monks petrified greedily drank in his words and gasped with
rapture   

after describing all the charms of the devil the beauty of evil and
the fascinating grace of the dreadful female form the old man cursed
the devil turned and shut himself up in his cell   

when he came out of his cell in the morning there was not a monk left in
the monastery they had all fled to the town
