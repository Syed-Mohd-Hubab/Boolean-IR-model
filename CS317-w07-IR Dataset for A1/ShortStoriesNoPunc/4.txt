a dead body

a still august night a mist is rising slowly from the fields and
casting an opaque veil over everything within eyesight lighted up by
the moon the mist gives the impression at one moment of a calm
boundless sea at the next of an immense white wall the air is damp and
chilly morning is still far off a step from the bye road which runs
along the edge of the forest a little fire is gleaming a dead body
covered from head to foot with new white linen is lying under a young
oak tree a wooden ikon is lying on its breast beside the corpse almost
on the road sits the watch two peasants performing one of the most
disagreeable and uninviting of peasants duties one a tall young
fellow with a scarcely perceptible moustache and thick black eyebrows
in a tattered sheepskin and bark shoes is sitting on the wet grass his
feet stuck out straight in front of him and is trying to while away the
time with work he bends his long neck and breathing loudly through his
nose makes a spoon out of a big crooked bit of wood the other a little
scraggy pock marked peasant with an aged face a scanty moustache and
a little goats beard sits with his hands dangling loose on his knees
and without moving gazes listlessly at the light a small camp fire is
lazily burning down between them throwing a red glow on their faces
there is perfect stillness the only sounds are the scrape of the knife
on the wood and the crackling of damp sticks in the fire

dont you go to sleep syoma    says the young man

i    i am not asleep    stammers the goat beard

thats all right    it would be dreadful to sit here alone one
would be frightened you might tell me something syoma

you are a queer fellow syomushka other people will laugh and tell a
story and sing a song but you there is no making you out you sit like
a scarecrow in the garden and roll your eyes at the fire you cant say
anything properly    when you speak you seem frightened i dare say
you are fifty but you have less sense than a child arent you sorry
that you are a simpleton

i am sorry the goat beard answers gloomily

and we are sorry to see your foolishness you may be sure you are a
good natured sober peasant and the only trouble is that you have no
sense in your head you should have picked up some sense for yourself if
the lord has afflicted you and given you no understanding you must make
an effort syoma    you should listen hard when anything goods
being said note it well and keep thinking and thinking    if there
is any word you dont understand you should make an effort and think
over in your head in what meaning the word is used do you see make an
effort if you dont gain some sense for yourself youll be a simpleton
and of no account at all to your dying day

all at once a long drawn out moaning sound is heard in the forest
something rustles in the leaves as though torn from the very top of the
tree and falls to the ground all this is faintly repeated by the echo
the young man shudders and looks enquiringly at his companion

its an owl at the little birds says syoma gloomily

why syoma its time for the birds to fly to the warm countries

to be sure it is time

it is chilly at dawn now it is co old the crane is a chilly creature
it is tender such cold is death to it i am not a crane but i am
frozen    put some more wood on

syoma gets up and disappears in the dark undergrowth while he is busy
among the bushes breaking dry twigs his companion puts his hand over
his eyes and starts at every sound syoma brings an armful of wood and
lays it on the fire the flame irresolutely licks the black twigs with
its little tongues then suddenly as though at the word of command
catches them and throws a crimson light on the faces the road the
white linen with its prominences where the hands and feet of the corpse
raise it the ikon the watch is silent the young man bends his neck
still lower and sets to work with still more nervous haste the goat 
beard sits motionless as before and keeps his eyes fixed on the fire 
 

ye that love not zion    shall be put to shame by the lord a
falsetto voice is suddenly heard singing in the stillness of the night
then slow footsteps are audible and the dark figure of a man in a short
monkish cassock and a broad brimmed hat with a wallet on his shoulders
comes into sight on the road in the crimson firelight

thy will be done o lord holy mother the figure says in a husky
falsetto i saw the fire in the outer darkness and my soul leapt for
joy    at first i thought it was men grazing a drove of horses then
i thought it cant be that since no horses were to be seen arent
they thieves i wondered arent they robbers lying in wait for a rich
lazarus arent they the gypsy people offering sacrifices to idols and
my soul leapt for joy go feodosy servant of god i said to myself
and win a martyrs crown and i flew to the fire like a light winged
moth now i stand before you and from your outer aspect i judge of your
souls you are not thieves and you are not heathens peace be to you

good evening

good orthodox people do you know how to reach the makuhinsky
brickyards from here

its close here you go straight along the road when you have gone a
mile and a half there will be ananova our village from the village
father you turn to the right by the river bank and so you will get to
the brickyards its two miles from ananova

god give you health and why are you sitting here

we are sitting here watching you see there is a dead body   

what what body holy mother

the pilgrim sees the white linen with the ikon on it and starts so
violently that his legs give a little skip this unexpected sight has an
overpowering effect upon him he huddles together and stands as though
rooted to the spot with wide open mouth and staring eyes for three
minutes he is silent as though he could not believe his eyes then
begins muttering

o lord holy mother i was going along not meddling with anyone and
all at once such an affliction

what may you be enquires the young man of the clergy

no    no    i go from one monastery to another    do you
know mi    mihail polikarpitch the foreman of the brickyard well i
am his nephew    thy will be done o lord why are you here

we are watching    we are told to

yes yes    mutters the man in the cassock passing his hand over
his eyes and where did the deceased come from

he was a stranger

such is life but ill    er    be getting on brothers    i
feel flustered i am more afraid of the dead than of anything my dear
souls and only fancy while this man was alive he wasnt noticed while
now when he is dead and given over to corruption we tremble before him
as before some famous general or a bishop    such is life was he
murdered or what

the lord knows maybe he was murdered or maybe he died of himself

yes yes    who knows brothers maybe his soul is now tasting the
joys of paradise

his soul is still hovering here near his body says the young man
it does not depart from the body for three days

hm yes    how chilly the nights are now it sets ones teeth
chattering    so then i am to go straight on and on   

till you get to the village and then you turn to the right by the
river bank

by the river bank    to be sure    why am i standing still i
must go on farewell brothers

the man in the cassock takes five steps along the road and stops

ive forgotten to put a kopeck for the burying he says good
orthodox friends can i give the money

you ought to know best you go the round of the monasteries if he died
a natural death it would go for the good of his soul if its a suicide
its a sin

thats true    and maybe it really was a suicide so i had better
keep my money oh sins sins give me a thousand roubles and i would
not consent to sit here    farewell brothers

the cassock slowly moves away and stops again

i cant make up my mind what i am to do he mutters to stay here by
the fire and wait till daybreak    i am frightened to go on is
dreadful too the dead man will haunt me all the way in the darkness 
  the lord has chastised me indeed over three hundred miles i have
come on foot and nothing happened and now i am near home and theres
trouble i cant go on   

it is dreadful that is true

i am not afraid of wolves of thieves or of darkness but i am afraid
of the dead i am afraid of them and that is all about it good
orthodox brothers i entreat you on my knees see me to the village

weve been told not to go away from the body

no one will see brothers upon my soul no one will see the lord will
reward you a hundredfold old man come with me i beg old man why are
you silent

he is a bit simple says the young man

you come with me friend i will give you five kopecks

for five kopecks i might says the young man scratching his head
but i was told not to if syoma here our simpleton will stay alone i
will take you syoma will you stay here alone

ill stay the simpleton consents

well thats all right then come along the young man gets up and
goes with the cassock a minute later the sound of their steps and their
talk dies away syoma shuts his eyes and gently dozes the fire begins
to grow dim and a big black shadow falls on the dead body
