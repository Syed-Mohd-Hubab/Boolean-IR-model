betrothed i

it was ten oclock in the evening and the full moon was shining over the
garden in the shumins house an evening service celebrated at the
request of the grandmother marfa mihalovna was just over and now
nadyashe had gone into the garden for a minutecould see the table
being laid for supper in the dining room and her grandmother bustling
about in her gorgeous silk dress father andrey a chief priest of the
cathedral was talking to nadyas mother nina ivanovna and now in the
evening light through the window her mother for some reason looked very
young andrey andreitch father andreys son was standing by listening
attentively

it was still and cool in the garden and dark peaceful shadows lay on
the ground there was a sound of frogs croaking far far away beyond
the town there was a feeling of may sweet may one drew deep breaths
and longed to fancy that not here but far away under the sky above the
trees far away in the open country in the fields and the woods the
life of spring was unfolding now mysterious lovely rich and holy
beyond the understanding of weak sinful man and for some reason one
wanted to cry

she nadya was already twenty three ever since she was sixteen she had
been passionately dreaming of marriage and at last she was engaged to
andrey andreitch the young man who was standing on the other side of
the window she liked him the wedding was already fixed for july  and
yet there was no joy in her heart she was sleeping badly her spirits
drooped    she could hear from the open windows of the basement
where the kitchen was the hurrying servants the clatter of knives the
banging of the swing door there was a smell of roast turkey and pickled
cherries and for some reason it seemed to her that it would be like
that all her life with no change no end to it

some one came out of the house and stood on the steps it was alexandr
timofeitch or as he was always called sasha who had come from moscow
ten days before and was staying with them years ago a distant relation
of the grandmother a gentlemans widow called marya petrovna a thin
sickly little woman who had sunk into poverty used to come to the house
to ask for assistance she had a son sasha it used for some reason to
be said that he had talent as an artist and when his mother died
nadyas grandmother had for the salvation of her soul sent him to the
komissarovsky school in moscow two years later he went into the school
of painting spent nearly fifteen years there and only just managed to
scrape through the leaving examination in the section of architecture
he did not set up as an architect however but took a job at a
lithographers he used to come almost every year usually very ill to
stay with nadyas grandmother to rest and recover

he was wearing now a frock coat buttoned up and shabby canvas trousers
crumpled into creases at the bottom and his shirt had not been ironed
and he had somehow all over a look of not being fresh he was very thin
with big eyes long thin fingers and a swarthy bearded face and all the
same he was handsome with the shumins he was like one of the family
and in their house felt he was at home and the room in which he lived
when he was there had for years been called sashas room standing on
the steps he saw nadya and went up to her

its nice here he said

of course its nice you ought to stay here till the autumn

yes i expect it will come to that i dare say i shall stay with you
till september

he laughed for no reason and sat down beside her

im sitting gazing at mother said nadya she looks so young from
here my mother has her weaknesses of course she added after a
pause but still she is an exceptional woman

yes she is very nice    sasha agreed your mother in her own way
of course is a very good and sweet woman but    how shall i say i
went early this morning into your kitchen and there i found four
servants sleeping on the floor no bedsteads and rags for bedding
stench bugs beetles    it is just as it was twenty years ago no
change at all well granny god bless her what else can you expect of
granny but your mother speaks french you know and acts in private
theatricals one would think she might understand

as sasha talked he used to stretch out two long wasted fingers before
the listeners face

it all seems somehow strange to me here now i am out of the habit of
it he went on there is no making it out nobody ever does anything
your mother spends the whole day walking about like a duchess granny
does nothing either nor you either and your andrey andreitch never
does anything either

nadya had heard this the year before and she fancied the year before
that too and she knew that sasha could not make any other criticism
and in old days this had amused her but now for some reason she felt
annoyed

thats all stale and i have been sick of it for ages she said and
got up you should think of something a little newer

he laughed and got up too and they went together toward the house she
tall handsome and well made beside him looked very healthy and
smartly dressed she was conscious of this and felt sorry for him and
for some reason awkward

and you say a great deal you should not she said youve just been
talking about my andrey but you see you dont know him

my andrey    bother him your andrey i am sorry for your youth

they were already sitting down to supper as the young people went into
the dining room the grandmother or granny as she was called in the
household a very stout plain old lady with bushy eyebrows and a little
moustache was talking loudly and from her voice and manner of speaking
it could be seen that she was the person of most importance in the
house she owned rows of shops in the market and the old fashioned
house with columns and the garden yet she prayed every morning that god
might save her from ruin and shed tears as she did so her daughter in 
law nadyas mother nina ivanovna a fair haired woman tightly laced
in with a pince nez and diamonds on every finger father andrey a
lean toothless old man whose face always looked as though he were just
going to say something amusing and his son andrey andreitch a stout
and handsome young man with curly hair looking like an artist or an
actor were all talking of hypnotism

you will get well in a week here said granny addressing sasha only
you must eat more what do you look like she sighed you are really
dreadful you are a regular prodigal son that is what you are

after wasting his fathers substance in riotous living said father
andrey slowly with laughing eyes he fed with senseless beasts

i like my dad said andrey andreitch touching his father on the
shoulder he is a splendid old fellow a dear old fellow

everyone was silent for a space sasha suddenly burst out laughing and
put his dinner napkin to his mouth

so you believe in hypnotism said father andrey to nina ivanovna

i cannot of course assert that i believe answered nina ivanovna
assuming a very serious even severe expression but i must own that
there is much that is mysterious and incomprehensible in nature

i quite agree with you though i must add that religion distinctly
curtails for us the domain of the mysterious

a big and very fat turkey was served father andrey and nina ivanovna
went on with their conversation nina ivanovnas diamonds glittered on
her fingers then tears began to glitter in her eyes she grew excited

though i cannot venture to argue with you she said you must admit
there are so many insoluble riddles in life

not one i assure you

after supper andrey andreitch played the fiddle and nina ivanovna
accompanied him on the piano ten years before he had taken his degree
at the university in the faculty of arts but had never held any post
had no definite work and only from time to time took part in concerts
for charitable objects and in the town he was regarded as a musician

andrey andreitch played they all listened in silence the samovar was
boiling quietly on the table and no one but sasha was drinking tea then
when it struck twelve a violin string suddenly broke everyone laughed
bustled about and began saying good bye

after seeing her fianc out nadya went upstairs where she and her
mother had their rooms the lower storey was occupied by the
grandmother they began putting the lights out below in the dining 
room while sasha still sat on drinking tea he always spent a long time
over tea in the moscow style drinking as much as seven glasses at a
time for a long time after nadya had undressed and gone to bed she
could hear the servants clearing away downstairs and granny talking
angrily at last everything was hushed and nothing could be heard but
sasha from time to time coughing on a bass note in his room below ii

when nadya woke up it must have been two oclock it was beginning to
get light a watchman was tapping somewhere far away she was not
sleepy and her bed felt very soft and uncomfortable nadya sat up in
her bed and fell to thinking as she had done every night in may her
thoughts were the same as they had been the night before useless
persistent thoughts always alike of how andrey andreitch had begun
courting her and had made her an offer how she had accepted him and
then little by little had come to appreciate the kindly intelligent
man but for some reason now when there was hardly a month left before
the wedding she began to feel dread and uneasiness as though something
vague and oppressive were before her

tick tock tick tock    the watchman tapped lazily    tick 
tock

through the big old fashioned window she could see the garden and at a
little distance bushes of lilac in full flower drowsy and lifeless from
the cold and the thick white mist was floating softly up to the lilac
trying to cover it drowsy rooks were cawing in the far away trees

my god why is my heart so heavy

perhaps every girl felt the same before her wedding there was no
knowing or was it sashas influence but for several years past sasha
had been repeating the same thing like a copybook and when he talked
he seemed nave and queer but why was it she could not get sasha out
of her head why was it

the watchman left off tapping for a long while the birds were
twittering under the windows and the mist had disappeared from the
garden everything was lighted up by the spring sunshine as by a smile
soon the whole garden warm and caressed by the sun returned to life
and dewdrops like diamonds glittered on the leaves and the old neglected
garden on that morning looked young and gaily decked

granny was already awake sashas husky cough began nadya could hear
them below setting the samovar and moving the chairs the hours passed
slowly nadya had been up and walking about the garden for a long while
and still the morning dragged on

at last nina ivanovna appeared with a tear stained face carrying a
glass of mineral water she was interested in spiritualism and
homeopathy read a great deal was fond of talking of the doubts to
which she was subject and to nadya it seemed as though there were a
deep mysterious significance in all that

now nadya kissed her mother and walked beside her

what have you been crying about mother she asked

last night i was reading a story in which there is an old man and his
daughter the old man is in some office and his chief falls in love with
his daughter i have not finished it but there was a passage which made
it hard to keep from tears said nina ivanovna and she sipped at her
glass i thought of it this morning and shed tears again

i have been so depressed all these days said nadya after a pause
why is it i dont sleep at night

i dont know dear when i cant sleep i shut my eyes very tightly
like this and picture to myself anna karenin moving about and talking
or something historical from the ancient world   

nadya felt that her mother did not understand her and was incapable of
understanding she felt this for the first time in her life and it
positively frightened her and made her want to hide herself and she
went away to her own room

at two oclock they sat down to dinner it was wednesday a fast day
and so vegetable soup and bream with boiled grain were set before
granny

to tease granny sasha ate his meat soup as well as the vegetable soup
he was making jokes all through dinner time but his jests were laboured
and invariably with a moral bearing and the effect was not at all
amusing when before making some witty remark he raised his very long
thin deathly looking fingers and when one remembered that he was very
ill and would probably not be much longer in this world one felt sorry
for him and ready to weep

after dinner granny went off to her own room to lie down nina ivanovna
played on the piano for a little and then she too went away

oh dear nadya sasha began his usual afternoon conversation if only
you would listen to me if only you would

she was sitting far back in an old fashioned armchair with her eyes
shut while he paced slowly about the room from corner to corner

if only you would go to the university he said only enlightened and
holy people are interesting its only they who are wanted the more of
such people there are the sooner the kingdom of god will come on earth
of your town then not one stone will be left everything will be blown
up from the foundations everything will be changed as though by magic
and then there will be immense magnificent houses here wonderful
gardens marvellous fountains remarkable people    but thats not
what matters most what matters most is that the crowd in our sense of
the word in the sense in which it exists nowthat evil will not exist
then because every man will believe and every man will know what he is
living for and no one will seek moral support in the crowd dear nadya
darling girl go away show them all that you are sick of this stagnant
grey sinful life prove it to yourself at least

i cant sasha im going to be married

oh nonsense whats it for

they went out into the garden and walked up and down a little

and however that may be my dear girl you must think you must realize
how unclean how immoral this idle life of yours is sasha went on do
understand that if for instance you and your mother and your
grandmother do nothing it means that someone else is working for you
you are eating up someone elses life and is that clean isnt it
filthy

nadya wanted to say yes that is true she wanted to say that she
understood but tears came into her eyes her spirits drooped and
shrinking into herself she went off to her room

towards evening andrey andreitch arrived and as usual played the fiddle
for a long time he was not given to much talk as a rule and was fond
of the fiddle perhaps because one could be silent while playing at
eleven oclock when he was about to go home and had put on his
greatcoat he embraced nadya and began greedily kissing her face her
shoulders and her hands

my dear my sweet my charmer he muttered oh how happy i am i am
beside myself with rapture

and it seemed to her as though she had heard that long long ago or had
read it somewhere    in some old tattered novel thrown away long ago
in the dining room sasha was sitting at the table drinking tea with the
saucer poised on his five long fingers granny was laying out patience
nina ivanovna was reading the flame crackled in the ikon lamp and
everything it seemed was quiet and going well nadya said good night
went upstairs to her room got into bed and fell asleep at once but
just as on the night before almost before it was light she woke up
she was not sleepy there was an uneasy oppressive feeling in her
heart she sat up with her head on her knees and thought of her fianc
and her marriage    she for some reason remembered that her mother
had not loved her father and now had nothing and lived in complete
dependence on her mother in law granny and however much nadya pondered
she could not imagine why she had hitherto seen in her mother something
special and exceptional how it was she had not noticed that she was a
simple ordinary unhappy woman

and sasha downstairs was not asleep she could hear him coughing he is
a queer nave man thought nadya and in all his dreams in all those
marvellous gardens and wonderful fountains one felt there was something
absurd but for some reason in his navet in this very absurdity
there was something so beautiful that as soon as she thought of the
possibility of going to the university it sent a cold thrill through
her heart and her bosom and flooded them with joy and rapture

but better not think better not think    she whispered i must
not think of it

tick tock tapped the watchman somewhere far away tick tock   
tick tock    iii

in the middle of june sasha suddenly felt bored and made up his mind to
return to moscow

i cant exist in this town he said gloomily no water supply no
drains it disgusts me to eat at dinner the filth in the kitchen is
incredible   

wait a little prodigal son granny tried to persuade him speaking
for some reason in a whisper the wedding is to be on the seventh

i dont want to

you meant to stay with us until september

but now you see i dont want to i must get to work

the summer was grey and cold the trees were wet everything in the
garden looked dejected and uninviting it certainly did make one long to
get to work the sound of unfamiliar womens voices was heard downstairs
and upstairs there was the rattle of a sewing machine in grannys room
they were working hard at the trousseau of fur coats alone six were
provided for nadya and the cheapest of them in grannys words had
cost three hundred roubles the fuss irritated sasha he stayed in his
own room and was cross but everyone persuaded him to remain and he
promised not to go before the first of july

time passed quickly on st peters day andrey andreitch went with nadya
after dinner to moscow street to look once more at the house which had
been taken and made ready for the young couple some time before it was
a house of two storeys but so far only the upper floor had been
furnished there was in the hall a shining floor painted and parqueted
there were viennese chairs a piano a violin stand there was a smell
of paint on the wall hung a big oil painting in a gold framea naked
lady and beside her a purple vase with a broken handle

an exquisite picture said andrey andreitch and he gave a respectful
sigh its the work of the artist shismatchevsky

then there was the drawing room with the round table and a sofa and
easy chairs upholstered in bright blue above the sofa was a big
photograph of father andrey wearing a priests velvet cap and
decorations then they went into the dining room in which there was a
sideboard then into the bedroom here in the half dusk stood two
bedsteads side by side and it looked as though the bedroom had been
decorated with the idea that it would always be very agreeable there and
could not possibly be anything else andrey andreitch led nadya about
the rooms all the while keeping his arm round her waist and she felt
weak and conscience stricken she hated all the rooms the beds the
easy chairs she was nauseated by the naked lady it was clear to her
now that she had ceased to love andrey andreitch or perhaps had never
loved him at all but how to say this and to whom to say it and with
what object she did not understand and could not understand though she
was thinking about it all day and all night    he held her round the
waist talked so affectionately so modestly was so happy walking
about this house of his while she saw nothing in it all but vulgarity
stupid nave unbearable vulgarity and his arm round her waist felt
as hard and cold as an iron hoop and every minute she was on the point
of running away bursting into sobs throwing herself out of a window
andrey andreitch led her into the bathroom and here he touched a tap
fixed in the wall and at once water flowed

what do you say to that he said and laughed i had a tank holding
two hundred gallons put in the loft and so now we shall have water

they walked across the yard and went out into the street and took a cab
thick clouds of dust were blowing and it seemed as though it were just
going to rain

you are not cold said andrey andreitch screwing up his eyes at the
dust

she did not answer

yesterday you remember sasha blamed me for doing nothing he said
after a brief silence well he is right absolutely right i do
nothing and can do nothing my precious why is it why is it that the
very thought that i may some day fix a cockade on my cap and go into the
government service is so hateful to me why do i feel so uncomfortable
when i see a lawyer or a latin master or a member of the zemstvo o
mother russia o mother russia what a burden of idle and useless people
you still carry how many like me are upon you long suffering mother

and from the fact that he did nothing he drew generalizations seeing in
it a sign of the times

when we are married let us go together into the country my precious
there we will work we will buy ourselves a little piece of land with a
garden and a river we will labour and watch life oh how splendid that
will be

he took off his hat and his hair floated in the wind while she
listened to him and thought good god i wish i were home

when they were quite near the house they overtook father andrey

ah heres father coming cried andrey andreitch delighted and he
waved his hat i love my dad really he said as he paid the cabman
hes a splendid old fellow a dear old fellow

nadya went into the house feeling cross and unwell thinking that there
would be visitors all the evening that she would have to entertain
them to smile to listen to the fiddle to listen to all sorts of
nonsense and to talk of nothing but the wedding

granny dignified gorgeous in her silk dress and haughty as she always
seemed before visitors was sitting before the samovar father andrey
came in with his sly smile

i have the pleasure and blessed consolation of seeing you in health
he said to granny and it was hard to tell whether he was joking or
speaking seriously iv

the wind was beating on the window and on the roof there was a
whistling sound and in the stove the house spirit was plaintively and
sullenly droning his song it was past midnight everyone in the house
had gone to bed but no one was asleep and it seemed all the while to
nadya as though they were playing the fiddle below there was a sharp
bang a shutter must have been torn off a minute later nina ivanovna
came in in her nightgown with a candle

what was the bang nadya she asked

her mother with her hair in a single plait and a timid smile on her
face looked older plainer smaller on that stormy night nadya
remembered that quite a little time ago she had thought her mother an
exceptional woman and had listened with pride to the things she said
and now she could not remember those things everything that came into
her mind was so feeble and useless

in the stove was the sound of several bass voices in chorus and she
even heard o o o my g o od nadya sat on her bed and suddenly she
clutched at her hair and burst into sobs

mother mother my own she said if only you knew what is happening
to me i beg you i beseech you let me go away i beseech you

where asked nina ivanovna not understanding and she sat down on the
bedstead go where

for a long while nadya cried and could not utter a word

let me go away from the town she said at last there must not and
will not be a wedding understand that i dont love that man    i
cant even speak about him

no my own no nina ivanovna said quickly terribly alarmed calm
yourselfits just because you are in low spirits it will pass it
often happens most likely you have had a tiff with andrey but lovers
quarrels always end in kisses

oh go away mother oh go away sobbed nadya

yes said nina ivanovna after a pause its not long since you were a
baby a little girl and now you are engaged to be married in nature
there is a continual transmutation of substances before you know where
you are you will be a mother yourself and an old woman and will have as
rebellious a daughter as i have

my darling my sweet you are clever you know you are unhappy said
nadya you are very unhappy why do you say such very dull commonplace
things for gods sake why

nina ivanovna tried to say something but could not utter a word she
gave a sob and went away to her own room the bass voices began droning
in the stove again and nadya felt suddenly frightened she jumped out
of bed and went quickly to her mother nina ivanovna with tear stained
face was lying in bed wrapped in a pale blue quilt and holding a book
in her hands

mother listen to me said nadya i implore you do understand if
you would only understand how petty and degrading our life is my eyes
have been opened and i see it all now and what is your andrey
andreitch why he is not intelligent mother merciful heavens do
understand mother he is stupid

nina ivanovna abruptly sat up

you and your grandmother torment me she said with a sob i want to
live to live she repeated and twice she beat her little fist upon
her bosom let me be free i am still young i want to live and you
have made me an old woman between you

she broke into bitter tears lay down and curled up under the quilt and
looked so small so pitiful so foolish nadya went to her room
dressed and sitting at the window fell to waiting for the morning she
sat all night thinking while someone seemed to be tapping on the
shutters and whistling in the yard

in the morning granny complained that the wind had blown down all the
apples in the garden and broken down an old plum tree it was grey
murky cheerless dark enough for candles everyone complained of the
cold and the rain lashed on the windows after tea nadya went into
sashas room and without saying a word knelt down before an armchair in
the corner and hid her face in her hands

what is it asked sasha

i cant    she said how i could go on living here before i cant
understand i cant conceive i despise the man i am engaged to i
despise myself i despise all this idle senseless existence

well well said sasha not yet grasping what was meant thats all
right    thats good

i am sick of this life nadya went on i cant endure another day
here to morrow i am going away take me with you for gods sake

for a minute sasha looked at her in astonishment at last he understood
and was delighted as a child he waved his arms and began pattering with
his slippers as though he were dancing with delight

splendid he said rubbing his hands my goodness how fine that is

and she stared at him without bblinking with adoring eyes as though
spellbound expecting every minute that he would say something
important something infinitely significant he had told her nothing
yet but already it seemed to her that something new and great was
opening before her which she had not known till then and already she
gazed at him full of expectation ready to face anything even death

i am going to morrow he said after a moments thought you come to
the station to see me off    ill take your things in my
portmanteau and ill get your ticket and when the third bell rings you
get into the carriage and well go off youll see me as far as moscow
and then go on to petersburg alone have you a passport

yes

i can promise you you wont regret it said sasha with conviction
you will go you will study and then go where fate takes you when you
turn your life upside down everything will be changed the great thing
is to turn your life upside down and all the rest is unimportant and
so we will set off to morrow

oh yes for gods sake

it seemed to nadya that she was very much excited that her heart was
heavier than ever before that she would spend all the time till she
went away in misery and agonizing thought but she had hardly gone
upstairs and lain down on her bed when she fell asleep at once with
traces of tears and a smile on her face and slept soundly till evening
v

a cab had been sent for nadya in her hat and overcoat went upstairs to
take one more look at her mother at all her belongings she stood in
her own room beside her still warm bed looked about her then went
slowly in to her mother nina ivanovna was asleep it was quite still in
her room nadya kissed her mother smoothed her hair stood still for a
couple of minutes    then walked slowly downstairs

it was raining heavily the cabman with the hood pulled down was
standing at the entrance drenched with rain

there is not room for you nadya said granny as the servants began
putting in the luggage what an idea to see him off in such weather
you had better stop at home goodness how it rains

nadya tried to say something but could not then sasha helped nadya in
and covered her feet with a rug then he sat down beside her

good luck to you god bless you granny cried from the steps mind
you write to us from moscow sasha

right good bye granny

the queen of heaven keep you

oh what weather said sasha

it was only now that nadya began to cry now it was clear to her that
she certainly was going which she had not really believed when she was
saying good bye to granny and when she was looking at her mother good 
bye town and she suddenly thought of it all andrey and his father
and the new house and the naked lady with the vase and it all no longer
frightened her nor weighed upon her but was nave and trivial and
continually retreated further away and when they got into the railway
carriage and the train began to move all that past which had been so
big and serious shrank up into something tiny and a vast wide future
which till then had scarcely been noticed began unfolding before her
the rain pattered on the carriage windows nothing could be seen but the
green fields telegraph posts with birds sitting on the wires flitted
by and joy made her hold her breath she thought that she was going to
freedom going to study and this was just like what used ages ago to
be called going off to be a free cossack

she laughed and cried and prayed all at once

its a all right said sasha smiling its a all right vi

autumn had passed and winter too had gone nadya had begun to be very
homesick and thought every day of her mother and her grandmother she
thought of sasha too the letters that came from home were kind and
gentle and it seemed as though everything by now were forgiven and
forgotten in may after the examinations she set off for home in good
health and high spirits and stopped on the way at moscow to see sasha
he was just the same as the year before with the same beard and unkempt
hair with the same large beautiful eyes and he still wore the same
coat and canvas trousers but he looked unwell and worried he seemed
both older and thinner and kept coughing and for some reason he struck
nadya as grey and provincial

my god nadya has come he said and laughed gaily my darling girl

they sat in the printing room which was full of tobacco smoke and
smelt strongly stiflingly of indian ink and paint then they went to
his room which also smelt of tobacco and was full of the traces of
spitting near a cold samovar stood a broken plate with dark paper on
it and there were masses of dead flies on the table and on the floor
and everything showed that sasha ordered his personal life in a slovenly
way and lived anyhow with utter contempt for comfort and if anyone
began talking to him of his personal happiness of his personal life of
affection for him he would not have understood and would have only
laughed

it is all right everything has gone well said nadya hurriedly
mother came to see me in petersburg in the autumn she said that granny
is not angry and only keeps going into my room and making the sign of
the cross over the walls

sasha looked cheerful but he kept coughing and talked in a cracked
voice and nadya kept looking at him unable to decide whether he really
were seriously ill or whether it were only her fancy

dear sasha she said you are ill

no its nothing i am ill but not very   

oh dear cried nadya in agitation why dont you go to a doctor
why dont you take care of your health my dear darling sasha she
said and tears gushed from her eyes and for some reason there rose
before her imagination andrey andreitch and the naked lady with the
vase and all her past which seemed now as far away as her childhood
and she began crying because sasha no longer seemed to her so novel so
cultured and so interesting as the year before dear sasha you are
very very ill    i would do anything to make you not so pale and
thin i am so indebted to you you cant imagine how much you have done
for me my good sasha in reality you are now the person nearest and
dearest to me

they sat on and talked and now after nadya had spent a winter in
petersburg sasha his works his smile his whole figure had for her a
suggestion of something out of date old fashioned done with long ago
and perhaps already dead and buried

i am going down the volga the day after tomorrow said sasha and
then to drink koumiss i mean to drink koumiss a friend and his wife
are going with me his wife is a wonderful woman i am always at her
trying to persuade her to go to the university i want her to turn her
life upside down

after having talked they drove to the station sasha got her tea and
apples and when the train began moving and he waved his handkerchief at
her smiling it could be seen even from his legs that he was very ill
and would not live long

nadya reached her native town at midday as she drove home from the
station the streets struck her as very wide and the houses very small
and squat there were no people about she met no one but the german
piano tuner in a rusty greatcoat and all the houses looked as though
they were covered with dust granny who seemed to have grown quite old
but was as fat and plain as ever flung her arms round nadya and cried
for a long time with her face on nadyas shoulder unable to tear
herself away nina ivanovna looked much older and plainer and seemed
shrivelled up but was still tightly laced and still had diamonds
flashing on her fingers

my darling she said trembling all over my darling

then they sat down and cried without speaking it was evident that both
mother and grandmother realized that the past was lost and gone never
to return they had now no position in society no prestige as before
no right to invite visitors so it is when in the midst of an easy
careless life the police suddenly burst in at night and made a search
and it turns out that the head of the family has embezzled money or
committed forgeryand goodbye then to the easy careless life for ever

nadya went upstairs and saw the same bed the same windows with nave
white curtains and outside the windows the same garden gay and noisy
bathed in sunshine she touched the table sat down and sank into
thought and she had a good dinner and drank tea with delicious rich
cream but something was missing there was a sense of emptiness in the
rooms and the ceilings were so low in the evening she went to bed
covered herself up and for some reason it seemed to her to be funny
lying in this snug very soft bed

nina ivanovna came in for a minute she sat down as people who feel
guilty sit down timidly and looking about her

well tell me nadya she enquired after a brief pause are you
contented quite contented

yes mother

nina ivanovna got up made the sign of the cross over nadya and the
windows

i have become religious as you see she said you know i am studying
philosophy now and i am always thinking and thinking    and many
things have become as clear as daylight to me it seems to me that what
is above all necessary is that life should pass as it were through a
prism

tell me mother how is granny in health

she seems all right when you went away that time with sasha and the
telegram came from you granny fell on the floor as she read it for
three days she lay without moving after that she was always praying and
crying but now she is all right again

she got up and walked about the room

tick tock tapped the watchman tick tock tick tock   

what is above all necessary is that life should pass as it were through
a prism she said in other words that life in consciousness should
be analyzed into its simplest elements as into the seven primary
colours and each element must be studied separately

what nina ivanovna said further and when she went away nadya did not
hear as she quickly fell asleep

may passed june came nadya had grown used to being at home granny
busied herself about the samovar heaving deep sighs nina ivanovna
talked in the evenings about her philosophy she still lived in the
house like a poor relation and had to go to granny for every farthing
there were lots of flies in the house and the ceilings seemed to become
lower and lower granny and nina ivanovna did not go out in the streets
for fear of meeting father andrey and andrey andreitch nadya walked
about the garden and the streets looked at the grey fences and it
seemed to her that everything in the town had grown old was out of date
and was only waiting either for the end or for the beginning of
something young and fresh oh if only that new bright life would come
more quicklythat life in which one will be able to face ones fate
boldly and directly to know that one is right to be light hearted and
free and sooner or later such a life will come the time will come when
of grannys house where things are so arranged that the four servants
can only live in one room in filth in the basementthe time will come
when of that house not a trace will remain and it will be forgotten no
one will remember it and nadyas only entertainment was from the boys
next door when she walked about the garden they knocked on the fence
and shouted in mockery betrothed betrothed

a letter from sasha arrived from saratov in his gay dancing handwriting
he told them that his journey on the volga had been a complete success
but that he had been taken rather ill in saratov had lost his voice
and had been for the last fortnight in the hospital she knew what that
meant and she was overwhelmed with a foreboding that was like a
conviction and it vexed her that this foreboding and the thought of
sasha did not distress her so much as before she had a passionate
desire for life longed to be in petersburg and her friendship with
sasha seemed now sweet but something far far away she did not sleep
all night and in the morning sat at the window listening and she did
in fact hear voices below granny greatly agitated was asking
questions rapidly then some one began crying    when nadya went
downstairs granny was standing in the corner praying before the ikon
and her face was tearful a telegram lay on the table

for some time nadya walked up and down the room listening to grannys
weeping then she picked up the telegram and read it

it announced that the previous morning alexandr timofeitch or more
simply sasha had died at saratov of consumption

granny and nina ivanovna went to the church to order a memorial service
while nadya went on walking about the rooms and thinking she recognized
clearly that her life had been turned upside down as sasha wished that
here she was alien isolated useless and that everything here was
useless to her that all the past had been torn away from her and
vanished as though it had been burnt up and the ashes scattered to the
winds she went into sashas room and stood there for a while

good bye dear sasha she thought and before her mind rose the vista
of a new wide spacious life and that life still obscure and full of
mysteries beckoned her and attracted her

she went upstairs to her own room to pack and next morning said good 
bye to her family and full of life and high spirits left the townas
she supposed for ever
