the horse stealers

a hospital assistant called yergunov an empty headed fellow known
throughout the district as a great braggart and drunkard was returning
one evening in christmas week from the hamlet of ryepino where he had
been to make some purchases for the hospital that he might get home in
good time and not be late the doctor had lent him his very best horse

at first it had been a still day but at eight oclock a violent snow 
storm came on and when he was only about four miles from home yergunov
completely lost his way

he did not know how to drive he did not know the road and he drove on
at random hoping that the horse would find the way of itself two hours
passed the horse was exhausted he himself was chilled and already
began to fancy that he was not going home but back towards ryepino but
at last above the uproar of the storm he heard the far away barking of a
dog and a murky red blur came into sight ahead of him little by
little the outlines of a high gate could be discerned then a long
fence on which there were nails with their points uppermost and beyond
the fence there stood the slanting crane of a well the wind drove away
the mist of snow from before the eyes and where there had been a red
blur there sprang up a small squat little house with a steep thatched
roof of the three little windows one covered on the inside with
something red was lighted up

what sort of place was it yergunov remembered that to the right of the
road three and a half or four miles from the hospital there was andrey
tchirikovs tavern he remembered too that this tchirikov who had
been lately killed by some sledge drivers had left a wife and a
daughter called lyubka who had come to the hospital two years before as
a patient the inn had a bad reputation and to visit it late in the
evening and especially with someone elses horse was not free from
risk but there was no help for it yergunov fumbled in his knapsack for
his revolver and coughing sternly tapped at the window frame with his
whip

hey who is within he cried hey granny let me come in and get
warm

with a hoarse bark a black dog rolled like a ball under the horses
feet then another white one then another black onethere must have
been a dozen of them yergunov looked to see which was the biggest
swung his whip and lashed at it with all his might a small long legged
puppy turned its sharp muzzle upwards and set up a shrill piercing
howl

yergunov stood for a long while at the window tapping but at last the
hoar frost on the trees near the house glowed red and a muffled female
figure appeared with a lantern in her hands

let me in to get warm granny said yergunov i was driving to the
hospital and i have lost my way its such weather god preserve us
dont be afraid we are your own people granny

all my own people are at home and we didnt invite strangers said
the figure grimly and what are you knocking for the gate is not
locked

yergunov drove into the yard and stopped at the steps

bid your labourer take my horse out granny said he

i am not granny

and indeed she was not a granny while she was putting out the lantern
the light fell on her face and yergunov saw black eyebrows and
recognized lyubka

there are no labourers about now she said as she went into the house
some are drunk and asleep and some have been gone to ryepino since the
morning its a holiday   

as he fastened his horse up in the shed yergunov heard a neigh and
distinguished in the darkness another horse and felt on it a cossack
saddle so there must be someone else in the house besides the woman and
her daughter for greater security yergunov unsaddled his horse and
when he went into the house took with him both his purchases and his
saddle

the first room into which he went was large and very hot and smelt of
freshly washed floors a short lean peasant of about forty with a
small fair beard wearing a dark blue shirt was sitting at the table
under the holy images it was kalashnikov an arrant scoundrel and
horse stealer whose father and uncle kept a tavern in bogalyovka and
disposed of the stolen horses where they could he too had been to the
hospital more than once not for medical treatment but to see the
doctor about horsesto ask whether he had not one for sale and whether
his honour would not like to swop his bay mare for a dun coloured
gelding now his head was pomaded and a silver ear ring glittered in his
ear and altogether he had a holiday air frowning and dropping his
lower lip he was looking intently at a big dogs eared picture book
another peasant lay stretched on the floor near the stove his head his
shoulders and his chest were covered with a sheepskinhe was probably
asleep beside his new boots with shining bits of metal on the heels
there were two dark pools of melted snow

seeing the hospital assistant kalashnikov greeted him

yes it is weather said yergunov rubbing his chilled knees with his
open hands the snow is up to ones neck i am soaked to the skin i
can tell you and i believe my revolver is too   

he took out his revolver looked it all over and put it back in his
knapsack but the revolver made no impression at all the peasant went
on looking at the book

yes it is weather    i lost my way and if it had not been for the
dogs here i do believe it would have been my death there would have
been a nice to do and where are the women

the old woman has gone to ryepino and the girl is getting supper ready
   answered kalashnikov

silence followed yergunov shivering and gasping breathed on his
hands huddled up and made a show of being very cold and exhausted the
still angry dogs could be heard howling outside it was dreary

you come from bogalyovka dont you he asked the peasant sternly

yes from bogalyovka

and to while away the time yergunov began to think about bogalyovka it
was a big village and it lay in a deep ravine so that when one drove
along the highroad on a moonlight night and looked down into the dark
ravine and then up at the sky it seemed as though the moon were hanging
over a bottomless abyss and it were the end of the world the path going
down was steep winding and so narrow that when one drove down to
bogalyovka on account of some epidemic or to vaccinate the people one
had to shout at the top of ones voice or whistle all the way for if
one met a cart coming up one could not pass the peasants of bogalyovka
had the reputation of being good gardeners and horse stealers they had
well stocked gardens in spring the whole village was buried in white
cherry blossom and in the summer they sold cherries at three kopecks a
pail one could pay three kopecks and pick as one liked their women
were handsome and looked well fed they were fond of finery and never
did anything even on working days but spent all their time sitting on
the ledge in front of their houses and searching in each others heads

but at last there was the sound of footsteps lyubka a girl of twenty
with bare feet and a red dress came into the room    she looked
sideways at yergunov and walked twice from one end of the room to the
other she did not move simply but with tiny steps thrusting forward
her bosom evidently she enjoyed padding about with her bare feet on the
freshly washed floor and had taken off her shoes on purpose

kalashnikov laughed at something and beckoned her with his finger she
went up to the table and he showed her a picture of the prophet elijah
who driving three horses abreast was dashing up to the sky lyubka put
her elbow on the table her plait fell across her shouldera long
chestnut plait tied with red ribbon at the endand it almost touched the
floor she too smiled

a splendid wonderful picture said kalashnikov wonderful he
repeated and motioned with his hand as though he wanted to take the
reins instead of elijah

the wind howled in the stove something growled and squeaked as though a
big dog had strangled a rat

ugh the unclean spirits are abroad said lyubka

thats the wind said kalashnikov and after a pause he raised his
eyes to yergunov and asked

and what is your learned opinion osip vassilyitchare there devils in
this world or not

whats one to say brother said yergunov and he shrugged one
shoulder if one reasons from science of course there are no devils
for its a superstition but if one looks at it simply as you and i do
now there are devils to put it shortly    i have seen a great deal
in my life    when i finished my studies i served as medical
assistant in the army in a regiment of the dragoons and i have been in
the war of course i have a medal and a decoration from the red cross
but after the treaty of san stefano i returned to russia and went into
the service of the zemstvo and in consequence of my enormous
circulation about the world i may say i have seen more than many
another has dreamed of it has happened to me to see devils too that
is not devils with horns and a tailthat is all nonsensebut just to
speak precisely something of the sort

where asked kalashnikov

in various places there is no need to go far last year i met him
herespeak of him not at nightnear this very inn i was driving i
remember to golyshino i was going there to vaccinate of course as
usual i had the racing droshky and a horse and all the necessary
paraphernalia and whats more i had a watch and all the rest of it
so i was on my guard as i drove along for fear of some mischance there
are lots of tramps of all sorts i came up to the zmeinoy
ravinedamnation take itand was just going down it when all at once
somebody comes up to mesuch a fellow black hair black eyes and his
whole face looked smutted with soot     he comes straight up to the
horse and takes hold of the left rein stop he looked at the horse
then at me then dropped the reins and without saying a bad word
where are you going says he and he showed his teeth in a grin and
his eyes were spiteful looking

ah thought i you are a queer customer i am going to vaccinate
for the smallpox said i and what is that to you well if thats
so says he vaccinate me he bared his arm and thrust it under my
nose of course i did not bandy words with him i just vaccinated him
to get rid of him afterwards i looked at my lancet and it had gone
rusty

the peasant who was asleep near the stove suddenly turned over and flung
off the sheepskin to his great surprise yergunov recognized the
stranger he had met that day at zmeinoy ravine this peasants hair
beard and eyes were black as soot his face was swarthy and to add to
the effect there was a black spot the size of a lentil on his right
cheek he looked mockingly at the hospital assistant and said

i did take hold of the left reinthat was so but about the smallpox
you are lying sir and there was not a word said about the smallpox
between us

yergunov was disconcerted

im not talking about you he said lie down since you are lying
down

the dark skinned peasant had never been to the hospital and yergunov
did not know who he was or where he came from and now looking at him
he made up his mind that the man must be a gypsy the peasant got up
and stretching and yawning loudly went up to lyubka and kalashnikov
and sat down beside them and he too began looking at the book his
sleepy face softened and a look of envy came into it

look merik lyubka said to him get me such horses and i will drive
to heaven

sinners cant drive to heaven said kalashnikov thats for
holiness

then lyubka laid the table and brought in a big piece of fat bacon
salted cucumbers a wooden platter of boiled meat cut up into little
pieces then a frying pan in which there were sausages and cabbage
spluttering a cut glass decanter of vodka which diffused a smell of
orange peel all over the room when it was poured out was put on the
table also

yergunov was annoyed that kalashnikov and the dark fellow merik talked
together and took no notice of him at all behaving exactly as though he
were not in the room and he wanted to talk to them to brag to drink
to have a good meal and if possible to have a little fun with lyubka
who sat down near him half a dozen times while they were at supper and
as though by accident brushed against him with her handsome shoulders
and passed her hands over her broad hips she was a healthy active
girl always laughing and never still she would sit down then get up
and when she was sitting down she would keep turning first her face and
then her back to her neighbour like a fidgety child and never failed
to brush against him with her elbows or her knees

and he was displeased too that the peasants drank only a glass each
and no more and it was awkward for him to drink alone but he could not
refrain from taking a second glass all the same then a third and he
ate all the sausage he brought himself to flatter the peasants that
they might accept him as one of the party instead of holding him at
arms length

you are a fine set of fellows in bogalyovka he said and wagged his
head

in what way fine fellows enquired kalashnikov

why about horses for instance fine fellows at stealing

hm fine fellows you call them nothing but thieves and drunkards

they have had their day but it is over said merik after a pause
but now they have only filya left and he is blind

yes there is no one but filya said kalashnikov with a sigh reckon
it up he must be seventy the german settlers knocked out one of his
eyes and he does not see well with the other it is cataract in old
days the police officer would shout as soon as he saw him hey you
shamil and all the peasants called him thathe was shamil all over the
place and now his only name is one eyed filya but he was a fine
fellow lyubas father andrey grigoritch and he stole one night into
rozhnovothere were cavalry regiments stationed thereand carried off
nine of the soldiers horses the very best of them they werent
frightened of the sentry and in the morning they sold all the horses
for twenty roubles to the gypsy afonka yes but nowadays a man
contrives to carry off a horse whose rider is drunk or asleep and has
no fear of god but will take the very boots from a drunkard and then
salinks off and goes away a hundred and fifty miles with a horse and
haggles at the market haggles like a jew till the policeman catches
him the fool there is no fun in it it is simply a disgrace a paltry
set of people i must say

what about merik asked lyubka

merik is not one of us said kalashnikov he is a harkov man from
mizhiritch but that he is a bold fellow thats the truth theres no
gainsaying that he is a fine fellow

lyubka looked slily and gleefully at merik and said

it wasnt for nothing they dipped him in a hole in the ice

how was that asked yergunov

it was like this    said merik and he laughed filya carried off
three horses from the samoylenka tenants and they pitched upon me
there were ten of the tenants at samoylenka and with their labourers
there were thirty altogether and all of them molokans     so one of
them says to me at the market come and have a look merik we have
brought some new horses from the fair i was interested of course i
went up to them and the whole lot of them thirty men tied my hands
behind me and led me to the river well show you fine horses they
said one hole in the ice was there already they cut another beside it
seven feet away then to be sure they took a cord and put a noose
under my armpits and tied a crooked stick to the other end long enough
to reach both holes they thrust the stick in and dragged it through i
went plop into the ice hole just as i was in my fur coat and my high
boots while they stood and shoved me one with his foot and one with
his stick then dragged me under the ice and pulled me out of the other
hole

lyubka shuddered and shrugged

at first i was in a fever from the cold merik went on but when they
pulled me out i was helpless and lay in the snow and the molokans
stood round and hit me with sticks on my knees and my elbows it hurt
fearfully they beat me and they went away    and everything on me
was frozen my clothes were covered with ice i got up but i couldnt
move thank god a woman drove by and gave me a lift

meanwhile yergunov had drunk five or six glasses of vodka his heart
felt lighter and he longed to tell some extraordinary wonderful story
too and to show that he too was a bold fellow and not afraid of
anything

ill tell you what happened to us in penza province    he began

either because he had drunk a great deal and was a little tipsy or
perhaps because he had twice been detected in a lie the peasants took
not the slightest notice of him and even left off answering his
questions what was worse they permitted themselves a frankness in his
presence that made him feel uncomfortable and cold all over and that
meant that they took no notice of him

kalashnikov had the dignified manners of a sedate and sensible man he
spoke weightily and made the sign of the cross over his mouth every
time he yawned and no one could have supposed that this was a thief a
heartless thief who had stripped poor creatures who had already been
twice in prison and who had been sentenced by the commune to exile in
siberia and had been bought off by his father and uncle who were as
great thieves and rogues as he was merik gave himself the airs of a
bravo he saw that lyubka and kalashnikov were admiring him and looked
upon himself as a very fine fellow and put his arms akimbo squared his
chest or stretched so that the bench creaked under him   

after supper kalashnikov prayed to the holy image without getting up
from his seat and shook hands with merik the latter prayed too and
shook kalashnikovs hand lyubka cleared away the supper shook out on
the table some peppermint biscuits dried nuts and pumpkin seeds and
placed two bottles of sweet wine

the kingdom of heaven and peace everlasting to andrey grigoritch said
kalashnikov calinking glasses with merik when he was alive we used to
gather together here or at his brother martins andmy word my word
what men what talks remarkable conversations martin used to be here
and filya and fyodor stukotey    it was all done in style it was
all in keeping    and what fun we had we did have fun we did have
fun

lyubka went out and soon afterwards came back wearing a green kerchief
and beads

look merik what kalashnikov brought me to day she said

she looked at herself in the looking glass and tossed her head several
times to make the beads jingle and then she opened a chest and began
taking out first a cotton dress with red and blue flowers on it and
then a red one with flounces which rustled and crackled like paper then
a new kerchief dark blue shot with many coloursand all these things
she showed and flung up her hands laughing as though astonished that
she had such treasures

kalashnikov tuned the balalaika and began playing it but yergunov could
not make out what sort of song he was singing and whether it was gay or
melancholy because at one moment it was so mournful he wanted to cry
and at the next it would be merry merik suddenly jumped up and began
tapping with his heels on the same spot then brandishing his arms he
moved on his heels from the table to the stove from the stove to the
chest then he bounded up as though he had been stung clicked the heels
of his boots together in the air and began going round and round in a
crouching position lyubka waved both her arms uttered a desperate
shriek and followed him at first she moved sideways like a snake as
though she wanted to steal up to someone and strike him from behind she
tapped rapidly with her bare heels as merik had done with the heels of
his boots then she turned round and round like a top and crouched down
and her red dress was blown out like a bell merik looking angrily at
her and showing his teeth in a grin flew towards her in the same
crouching posture as though he wanted to crush her with his terrible
legs while she jumped up flung back her head and waving her arms as a
big bird does its wings floated across the room scarcely touching the
floor   

what a flame of a girl thought yergunov sitting on the chest and
from there watching the dance what fire give up everything for her
and it would be too little    

and he regretted that he was a hospital assistant and not a simple
peasant that he wore a reefer coat and a chain with a gilt key on it
instead of a blue shirt with a cord tied round the waist then he could
boldly have sung danced flung both arms round lyubka as merik did  


the sharp tapping shouts and whoops set the crockery ringing in the
cupboard and the flame of the candle dancing

the thread broke and the beads were scattered all over the floor the
green kerchief slipped off and lyubka was transformed into a red cloud
flitting by and flashing black eyes and it seemed as though in another
second meriks arms and legs would drop off

but finally merik stamped for the last time and stood still as though
turned to stone exhausted and almost breathless lyubka sank on to his
bosom and leaned against him as against a post and he put his arms
round her and looking into her eyes said tenderly and caressingly as
though in jest

ill find out where your old mothers money is hidden ill murder her
and cut your little throat for you and after that i will set fire to
the inn    people will think you have perished in the fire and with
your money i shall go to kuban ill keep droves of horses and flocks of
sheep   

lyubka made no answer but only looked at him with a guilty air and
asked

and is it nice in kuban merik

he said nothing but went to the chest sat down and sank into thought
most likely he was dreaming of kuban

its time for me to be going said kalashnikov getting up filya
must be waiting for me goodbye lyuba

yergunov went out into the yard to see that kalashnikov did not go off
with his horse the snowstorm still persisted white clouds were
floating about the yard their long tails clinging to the rough grass
and the bushes while on the other side of the fence in the open country
huge giants in white robes with wide sleeves were whirling round and
falling to the ground and getting up again to wave their arms and
fight and the wind the wind the bare birches and cherry trees unable
to endure its rude caresses bowed low down to the ground and wailed
god for what sin hast thou bound us to the earth and will not let us
go free

wo said kalashnikov sternly and he got on his horse one half of the
gate was opened and by it lay a high snowdrift well get on shouted
kalashnikov his little short legged nag set off and sank up to its
stomach in the drift at once kalashnikov was white all over with the
snow and soon vanished from sight with his horse

when yergunov went back into the room lyubka was creeping about the
floor picking up her beads merik was not there

a splendid girl thought yergunov as he lay down on the bench and put
his coat under his head oh if only merik were not here lyubka
excited him as she crept about the floor by the bench and he thought
that if merik had not been there he would certainly have got up and
embraced her and then one would see what would happen it was true she
was only a girl but not likely to be chaste and even if she wereneed
one stand on ceremony in a den of thieves lyubka collected her beads
and went out the candle burnt down and the flame caught the paper in
the candlestick yergunov laid his revolver and matches beside him and
put out the candle the light before the holy images flickered so much
that it hurt his eyes and patches of light danced on the ceiling on
the floor and on the cupboard and among them he had visions of lyubka
buxom full bosomed now she was turning round like a top now she was
exhausted and breathless   

oh if the devils would carry off that merik he thought

the little lamp gave a last flicker spluttered and went out someone
it must have been merik came into the room and sat down on the bench
he puffed at his pipe and for an instant lighted up a dark cheek with a
patch on it yergunovs throat was irritated by the horrible fumes of
the tobacco smoke

what filthy tobacco you have gotdamnation take it said yergunov it
makes me positively sick

i mix my tobacco with the flowers of the oats answered merik after a
pause it is better for the chest

he smoked spat and went out again half an hour passed and all at
once there was the gleam of a light in the passage merik appeared in a
coat and cap then lyubka with a candle in her hand

do stay merik said lyubka in an imploring voice

no lyuba dont keep me

listen merik said lyubka and her voice grew soft and tender i
know you will find mothers money and will do for her and for me and
will go to kuban and love other girls but god be with you i only ask
you one thing sweetheart do stay

no i want some fun    said merik fastening his belt

but you have nothing to go on    you came on foot what are you
going on

merik bent down to lyubka and whispered something in her ear she looked
towards the door and laughed through her tears

he is asleep the puffed up devil    she said

merik embraced her kissed her vigorously and went out yergunov thrust
his revolver into his pocket jumped up and ran after him

get out of the way he said to lyubka who hurriedly bolted the door
of the entry and stood across the threshold let me pass why are you
standing here

what do you want to go out for

to have a look at my horse

lyubka gazed up at him with a sly and caressing look

why look at it you had better look at me     she said then she
bent down and touched with her finger the gilt watch key that hung on
his chain

let me pass or he will go off on my horse said yergunov let me go
you devil he shouted and giving her an angry blow on the shoulder he
pressed his chest against her with all his might to push her away from
the door but she kept tight hold of the bolt and was like iron

let me go he shouted exhausted he will go off with it i tell
you

why should he he wont breathing hard and rubbing her shoulder
which hurt she looked up at him again flushed a little and laughed
dont go away dear heart she said i am dull alone

yergunov looked into her eyes hesitated and put his arms round her
she did not resist

come no nonsense let me go he begged her she did not speak

i heard you just now he said telling merik that you love him

i dare say    my heart knows who it is i love

she put her finger on the key again and said softly give me that

yergunov unfastened the key and gave it to her she suddenly craned her
neck and listened with a grave face and her expression struck yergunov
as cold and cunning he thought of his horse and now easily pushed her
aside and ran out into the yard in the shed a sleepy pig was grunting
with lazy regularity and a cow was knocking her horn yergunov lighted a
match and saw the pig and the cow and the dogs which rushed at him on
all sides at seeing the light but there was no trace of the horse
shouting and waving his arms at the dogs stumbling over the drifts and
sticking in the snow he ran out at the gate and fell to gazing into the
darkness he strained his eyes to the utmost and saw only the snow
flying and the snowflakes distinctly forming into all sorts of shapes
at one moment the white laughing face of a corpse would peep out of the
darkness at the next a white horse would gallop by with an amazon in a
muslin dress upon it at the next a string of white swans would fly
overhead    shaking with anger and cold and not knowing what to do
yergunov fired his revolver at the dogs and did not hit one of them
then he rushed back to the house

when he went into the entry he distinctly heard someone scurry out of
the room and bang the door it was dark in the room yergunov pushed
against the door it was locked then lighting match after match he
rushed back into the entry from there into the kitchen and from the
kitchen into a little room where all the walls were hung with petticoats
and dresses where there was a smell of cornflowers and fennel and a
bedstead with a perfect mountain of pillows standing in the corner by
the stove this must have been the old mothers room from there he
passed into another little room and here he saw lyubka she was lying
on a chest covered with a gay coloured patchwork cotton quilt
pretending to be asleep a little ikon lamp was burning in the corner
above the pillow

where is my horse yergunov asked

lyubka did not stir

where is my horse i am asking you yergunov repeated still more
sternly and he tore the quilt off her i am asking you she devil he
shouted

she jumped up on her knees and with one hand holding her shift and with
the other trying to clutch the quilt huddled against the wall    
she looked at yergunov with repulsion and terror in her eyes and like
a wild beast in a trap kept cunning watch on his faintest movement

tell me where my horse is or ill knock the life out of you shouted
yergunov

get away dirty brute she said in a hoarse voice

yergunov seized her by the shift near the neck and tore it and then he
could not restrain himself and with all his might embraced the girl
but hissing with fury she slipped out of his arms and freeing one
handthe other was tangled in the torn shifthit him a blow with her
fist on the skull

his head was dizzy with the pain there was a ringing and rattling in
his ears he staggered back and at that moment received another
blowthis time on the temple reeling and clutching at the doorposts
that he might not fall he made his way to the room where his things
were and lay down on the bench then after lying for a little time
took the matchbox out of his pocket and began lighting match after match
for no object he lit it blew it out and threw it under the table and
went on till all the matches were gone

meanwhile the air began to turn blue outside the cocks began to crow
but his head still ached and there was an uproar in his ears as though
he were sitting under a railway bridge and hearing the trains passing
over his head he got somehow into his coat and cap the saddle and
the bundle of his purchases he could not find his knapsack was empty
it was not for nothing that someone had scurried out of the room when he
came in from the yard

he took a poker from the kitchen to keep off the dogs and went out into
the yard leaving the door open the snow storm had subsided and it was
calm outside    when he went out at the gate the white plain looked
dead and there was not a single bird in the morning sky on both sides
of the road and in the distance there were bluish patches of young
copse

yergunov began thinking how he would be greeted at the hospital and what
the doctor would say to him it was absolutely necessary to think of
that and to prepare beforehand to answer questions he would be asked
but this thought grew blurred and slipped away he walked along thinking
of nothing but lyubka of the peasants with whom he had passed the
night he remembered how after lyubka struck him the second time she
had bent down to the floor for the quilt and how her loose hair had
fallen on the floor his mind was in a maze and he wondered why there
were in the world doctors hospital assistants merchants clerks and
peasants instead of simple free men there are to be sure free birds
free beasts a free merik and they are not afraid of anyone and dont
need anyone and whose idea was it who had decreed that one must get up
in the morning dine at midday go to bed in the evening that a doctor
takes precedence of a hospital assistant that one must live in rooms
and love only ones wife and why not the contrarydine at night and
sleep in the day ah to jump on a horse without enquiring whose it is
to ride races with the wind like a devil over fields and forests and
ravines to make love to girls to mock at everyone    

yergunov thrust the poker into the snow pressed his forehead to the
cold white trunk of a birch tree and sank into thought and his grey
monotonous life his wages his subordinate position the dispensary
the everlasting to do with the bottles and blisters struck him as
contemptible sickening

who says its a sin to enjoy oneself he asked himself with vexation
those who say that have never lived in freedom like merik and
kalashnikov and have never loved lyubka they have been beggars all
their lives have lived without any pleasure and have only loved their
wives who are like frogs

and he thought about himself that he had not hitherto been a thief a
swindler or even a brigand simply because he could not or had not yet
met with a suitable opportunity 

a year and a half passed in spring after easter yergunov who had
long before been dismissed from the hospital and was hanging about
without a job came out of the tavern in ryepino and sauntered aimlessly
along the street

he went out into the open country here there was the scent of spring
and a warm caressing wind was blowing the calm starry night looked
down from the sky on the earth my god how infinite the depth of the
sky and with what fathomless immensity it stretched over the world the
world is created well enough only why and with what right do people
thought yergunov divide their fellows into the sober and the drunken
the employed and the dismissed and so on why do the sober and well fed
sleep comfortably in their homes while the drunken and the hungry must
wander about the country without a refuge why was it that if anyone had
not a job and did not get a salary he had to go hungry without clothes
and boots whose idea was it why was it the birds and the wild beasts
in the woods did not have jobs and get salaries but lived as they
pleased

far away in the sky a beautiful crimson glow lay quivering stretched
wide over the horizon yergunov stopped and for a long time he gazed at
it and kept wondering why was it that if he had carried off someone
elses samovar the day before and sold it for drink in the taverns it
would be a sin why was it

two carts drove by on the road in one of them there was a woman asleep
in the other sat an old man without a cap on

grandfather where is that fire asked yergunov

andrey tchirikovs inn answered the old man

and yergunov recalled what had happened to him eighteen months before in
the winter in that very inn and how merik had boasted and he imagined
the old woman and lyubka with their throats cut burning and he envied
merik and when he walked back to the tavern looking at the houses of
the rich publicans cattle dealers and blacksmiths he reflected how
nice it would be to steal by night into some rich mans house
