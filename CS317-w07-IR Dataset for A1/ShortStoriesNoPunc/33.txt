a bad business who goes there

no answer the watchman sees nothing but through the roar of the wind
and the trees distinctly hears someone walking along the avenue ahead of
him a march night cloudy and foggy envelopes the earth and it seems
to the watchman that the earth the sky and he himself with his
thoughts are all merged together into something vast and impenetrably
black he can only grope his way

who goes there the watchman repeats and he begins to fancy that he
hears whispering and smothered laughter whos there

its i friend    answers an old mans voice

but who are you

i    a traveller

what sort of traveller the watchman cries angrily trying to disguise
his terror by shouting what the devil do you want here you go
prowling about the graveyard at night you ruffian

you dont say its a graveyard here

why what else of course its the graveyard dont you see it is

oooh    queen of heaven there is a sound of an old man sighing
i see nothing my good soul nothing oh the darkness the darkness
you cant see your hand before your face it is dark friend oooh 


but who are you

i am a pilgrim friend a wandering man

the devils the nightbirds    nice sort of pilgrims they are
drunkards    mutters the watchman reassured by the tone and sighs
of the stranger ones tempted to sin by you they drink the day away
and prowl about at night but i fancy i heard you were not alone it
sounded like two or three of you

i am alone friend alone quite alone oooh our sins   

the watchman stumbles up against the man and stops

how did you get here he asks

i have lost my way good man i was walking to the mitrievsky mill and
i lost my way

whew is this the road to mitrievsky mill you sheepshead for the
mitrievsky mill you must keep much more to the left straight out of the
town along the high road you have been drinking and have gone a couple
of miles out of your way you must have had a drop in the town

i did friend    truly i did i wont hide my sins but how am i to
go now

go straight on and on along this avenue till you can go no farther and
then turn at once to the left and go till you have crossed the whole
graveyard right to the gate there will be a gate there    open it
and go with gods blessing mind you dont fall into the ditch and when
you are out of the graveyard you go all the way by the fields till you
come out on the main road

god give you health friend may the queen of heaven save you and have
mercy on you you might take me along good man be merciful lead me to
the gate

as though i had the time to waste go by yourself

be merciful ill pray for you i cant see anything one cant see
ones hand before ones face friend    its so dark so dark show
me the way sir

as though i had the time to take you about if i were to play the nurse
to everyone i should never have done

for christs sake take me i cant see and i am afraid to go alone
through the graveyard its terrifying friend its terrifying i am
afraid good man

theres no getting rid of you sighs the watchman all right then
come along

the watchman and the traveller go on together they walk shoulder to
shoulder in silence a damp cutting wind blows straight into their
faces and the unseen trees murmuring and rustling scatter big drops upon
them    the path is almost entirely covered with puddles

there is one thing passes my understanding says the watchman after a
prolonged silencehow you got here the gates locked did you climb
over the wall if you did climb over the wall thats the last thing you
would expect of an old man

i dont know friend i dont know i cant say myself how i got here
its a visitation a chastisement of the lord truly a visitation the
evil one confounded me so you are a watchman here friend

yes

the only one for the whole graveyard

there is such a violent gust of wind that both stop for a minute
waiting till the violence of the wind abates the watchman answers

there are three of us but one is lying ill in a fever and the others
asleep he and i take turns about

ah to be sure friend what a wind the dead must hear it it howls
like a wild beast oooh

and where do you come from

from a distance friend i am from vologda a long way off i go from
one holy place to another and pray for people save me and have mercy
upon me o lord

the watchman stops for a minute to light his pipe he stoops down behind
the travellers back and lights several matches the gleam of the first
match lights up for one instant a bit of the avenue on the right a
white tombstone with an angel and a dark cross the light of the second
match flaring up brightly and extinguished by the wind flashes like
lightning on the left side and from the darkness nothing stands out but
the angle of some sort of trellis the third match throws light to right
and to left revealing the white tombstone the dark cross and the
trellis round a childs grave

the departed sleep the dear ones sleep the stranger mutters sighing
loudly they all sleep alike rich and poor wise and foolish good and
wicked they are of the same value now and they will sleep till the
last trump the kingdom of heaven and peace eternal be theirs

here we are walking along now but the time will come when we shall be
lying here ourselves says the watchman

to be sure to be sure we shall all there is no man who will not die
oooh our doings are wicked our thoughts are deceitful sins sins
my soul accursed ever covetous my belly greedy and lustful i have
angered the lord and there is no salvation for me in this world and the
next i am deep in sins like a worm in the earth

yes and you have to die

you are right there

death is easier for a pilgrim than for fellows like us says the
watchman

there are pilgrims of different sorts there are the real ones who are
godfearing men and watch over their own souls and there are such as
stray about the graveyard at night and are a delight to the devils  
yees theres one who is a pilgrim could give you a crack on the pate
with an axe if he liked and knock the breath out of you

what are you talking like that for

oh nothing    why i fancy heres the gate yes it is open it
good man

the watchman feeling his way opens the gate leads the pilgrim out by
the sleeve and says

heres the end of the graveyard now you must keep on through the open
fields till you get to the main road only close here there will be the
boundary ditchdont fall in    and when you come out on to the
road turn to the right and keep on till you reach the mill   

oooh sighs the pilgrim after a pause and now i am thinking that i
have no cause to go to mitrievsky mill    why the devil should i go
there i had better stay a bit with you here sir   

what do you want to stay with me for

oh    its merrier with you    

so youve found a merry companion have you you pilgrim are fond of
a joke i see   

to be sure i am says the stranger with a hoarse chuckle ah my
dear good man i bet you will remember the pilgrim many a long year

why should i remember you

why ive got round you so smartly    am i a pilgrim i am not a
pilgrim at all

what are you then

a dead man    ive only just got out of my coffin    do you
remember gubaryev the locksmith who hanged himself in carnival week
well i am gubaryev himself   

tell us something else

the watchman does not believe him but he feels all over such a cold
oppressive terror that he starts off and begins hurriedly feeling for
the gate

stop where are you off to says the stranger clutching him by the
arm aie aie aie    what a fellow you are how can you leave me
all alone

let go cries the watchman trying to pull his arm away

stoop i bid you stop and you stop dont struggle you dirty dog if
you want to stay among the living stop and hold your tongue till i tell
you its only that i dont care to spill blood or you would have been a
dead man long ago you scurvy rascal    stop

the watchmans knees give way under him in his terror he shuts his
eyes and trembling all over huddles close to the wall he would like to
call out but he knows his cries would not reach any living thing the
stranger stands beside him and holds him by the arm    three minutes
pass in silence

ones in a fever anothers asleep and the third is seeing pilgrims on
their way mutters the stranger capital watchmen they are worth
their salary yees brother thieves have always been cleverer than
watchmen stand still dont stir   

five minutes ten minutes pass in silence all at once the wind brings
the sound of a whistle

well now you can go says the stranger releasing the watchmans arm
go and thank god you are alive

the stranger gives a whistle too runs away from the gate and the
watchman hears him leap over the ditch

with a foreboding of something very dreadful in his heart the watchman
still trembling with terror opens the gate irresolutely and runs back
with his eyes shut

at the turning into the main avenue he hears hurried footsteps and
someone asks him in a hissing voice is that you timofey where is
mitka

and after running the whole length of the main avenue he notices a
little dim light in the darkness the nearer he gets to the light the
more frightened he is and the stronger his foreboding of evil

it looks as though the light were in the church he thinks and how
can it have come there save me and have mercy on me queen of heaven
and that it is

the watchman stands for a minute before the broken window and looks with
horror towards the altar    a little wax candle which the thieves
had forgotten to put out flickers in the wind that bursts in at the
window and throws dim red patches of light on the vestments flung about
and a cupboard overturned on the floor on numerous footprints near the
high altar and the altar of offerings

a little time passes and the howling wind sends floating over the
churchyard the hurried uneven clangs of the alarmbell
