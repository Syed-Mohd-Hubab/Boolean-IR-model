a happy ending

lyubov grigoryevna a substantial buxom lady of forty who undertook
matchmaking and many other matters of which it is usual to speak only in
whispers had come to see stytchkin the head guard on a day when he
was off duty stytchkin somewhat embarrassed but as always grave
practical and severe was walking up and down the room smoking a cigar
and saying

very pleased to make your acquaintance semyon ivanovitch recommended
you on the ground that you may be able to assist me in a delicate and
very important matter affecting the happiness of my life i have lyubov
grigoryevna reached the age of fifty two that is a period of life at
which very many have already grown up children my position is a secure
one though my fortune is not large yet i am in a position to support a
beloved being and children at my side i may tell you between ourselves
that apart from my salary i have also money in the bank which my manner
of living has enabled me to save i am a practical and sober man i lead
a sensible and consistent life so that i may hold myself up as an
example to many but one thing i lacka domestic hearth of my own and a
partner in life and i live like a wandering magyar moving from place
to place without any satisfaction i have no one with whom to take
counsel and when i am ill no one to give me water and so on apart
from that lyubov grigoryevna a married man has always more weight in
society than a bachelor    i am a man of the educated class with
money but if you look at me from a point of view what am i a man with
no kith and kin no better than some polish priest and therefore i
should be very desirous to be united in the bonds of hymenthat is to
enter into matrimony with some worthy person

an excellent thing said the matchmaker with a sigh

i am a solitary man and in this town i know no one where can i go and
to whom can i apply since all the people here are strangers to me that
is why semyon ivanovitch advised me to address myself to a person who is
a specialist in this line and makes the arrangement of the happiness of
others her profession and therefore i most earnestly beg you lyubov
grigoryevna to assist me in ordering my future you know all the
marriageable young ladies in the town and it is easy for you to
accommodate me

i can   

a glass of wine i beg you   

with an habitual gesture the matchmaker raised her glass to her mouth
and tossed it off without winking

i can she repeated and what sort of bride would you like nikolay
nikolayitch

should i like the bride fate sends me

well of course it depends on your fate but everyone has his own
taste you know one likes dark ladies the other prefers fair ones

you see lyubov grigoryevna said stytchkin sighing sedately i am a
practical man and a man of character for me beauty and external
appearance generally take a secondary place for as you know yourself
beauty is neither bowl nor platter and a pretty wife involves a great
deal of anxiety the way i look at it is what matters most in a woman
is not what is external but what lies withinthat is that she should
have soul and all the qualities a glass of wine i beg    of
course it would be very agreeable that ones wife should be rather
plump but for mutual happiness it is not of great consequence what
matters is the mind properly speaking a woman does not need mind
either for if she has brains she will have too high an opinion of
herself and take all sorts of ideas into her head one cannot do
without education nowadays of course but education is of different
kinds it would be pleasing for ones wife to know french and german to
speak various languages very pleasing but whats the use of that if
she cant sew on ones buttons perhaps i am a man of the educated
class i am just as much at home i may say with prince kanitelin as i
am with you here now but my habits are simple and i want a girl who is
not too much a fine lady above all she must have respect for me and
feel that i have made her happiness

to be sure

well now as regards the essential    i do not want a wealthy
bride i would never condescend to anything so low as to marry for
money i desire not to be kept by my wife but to keep her and that she
may be sensible of it but i do not want a poor girl either though i am
a man of means and am marrying not from mercenary motives but from
love yet i cannot take a poor girl for as you know yourself prices
have gone up so and there will be children

one might find one with a dowry said the matchmaker

a glass of wine i beg   

there was a pause of five minutes

the matchmaker heaved a sigh took a sidelong glance at the guard and
asked

well now my good sir    do you want anything in the bachelor line
i have some fine bargains one is a french girl and one is a greek well
worth the money

the guard thought a moment and said

no i thank you in view of your favourable disposition allow me to
enquire now how much you ask for your exertions in regard to a bride

i dont ask much give me twenty five roubles and the stuff for a
dress as is usual and i will say thank you    but for the dowry
thats a different account

stytchkin folded his arms over his chest and fell to pondering in
silence after some thought he heaved a sigh and said

thats dear   

its not at all dear nikolay nikolayitch in old days when there were
lots of weddings one did do it cheaper but nowadays what are our
earnings if you make fifty roubles in a month that is not a fast you
may be thankful its not on weddings we make our money my good sir

stytchkin looked at the matchmaker in amazement and shrugged his
shoulders

hm    do you call fifty roubles little he asked

of course it is little in old days we sometimes made more than a
hundred

hm i should never have thought it was possible to earn such a sum by
these jobs fifty roubles it is not every man that earns as much pray
drink your wine   

the matchmaker drained her glass without winking stytchkin looked her
over from head to foot in silence then said

fifty roubles    why that is six hundred roubles a year   
please take some more   with such dividends you know lyubov
grigoryevna you would have no difficulty in making a match for
yourself   

for myself laughed the matchmaker i am an old woman

not at all    you have such a figure and your face is plump and
fair and all the rest of it

the matchmaker was embarrassed stytchkin was also embarrassed and sat
down beside her

you are still very attractive said he if you met with a practical
steady careful husband with his salary and your earnings you might
even attract him very much and youd get on very well together   

goodness knows what you are saying nikolay nikolayitch

well i meant no harm   

a silence followed stytchkin began loudly blowing his nose while the
matchmaker turned crimson and looking bashfully at him asked

and how much do you get nikolay nikolayitch

i seventy five roubles besides tips    apart from that we make
something out of candles and hares

you go hunting then

no passengers who travel without tickets are called hares with us

another minute passed in silence stytchkin got up and walked about the
room in excitement

i dont want a young wife said he i am a middle aged man and i
want someone who    as it might be like you    staid and settled
and a figure something like yours   

goodness knows what you are saying    giggled the matchmaker
hiding her crimson face in her kerchief

there is no need to be long thinking about it you are after my own
heart and you suit me in your qualities i am a practical sober man
and if you like me    what could be better allow me to make you a
proposal

the matchmaker dropped a tear laughed and in token of her consent
calinked glasses with stytchkin

well said the happy railway guard now allow me to explain to you
the behaviour and manner of life i desire from you    i am a strict
respectable practical man i take a gentlemanly view of everything and
i desire that my wife should be strict also and should understand that
to her i am a benefactor and the foremost person in the world

he sat down and heaving a deep sigh began expounding to his bride 
elect his views on domestic life and a wifes duties
