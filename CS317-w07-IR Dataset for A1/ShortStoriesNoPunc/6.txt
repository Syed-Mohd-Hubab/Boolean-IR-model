the lookingglass

new years eve nellie the daughter of a landowner and general a young
and pretty girl dreaming day and night of being married was sitting in
her room gazing with exhausted halfclosed eyes into the looking
glass she was pale tense and as motionless as the lookingglass

the nonexistent but apparent vista of a long narrow corridor with
endless rows of candles the reflection of her face her hands of the
frameall this was already clouded in mist and merged into a boundless
grey sea the sea was undulating gleaming and now and then flaring
crimson   

looking at nellies motionless eyes and parted lips one could hardly
say whether she was asleep or awake but nevertheless she was seeing at
first she saw only the smile and soft charming expression of someones
eyes then against the shifting grey background there gradually appeared
the outlines of a head a face eyebrows beard it was he the destined
one the object of long dreams and hopes the destined one was for
nellie everything the significance of life personal happiness career
fate outside him as on the grey background of the lookingglass all
was dark empty meaningless and so it was not strange that seeing
before her a handsome gently smiling face she was conscious of bliss
of an unutterably sweet dream that could not be expressed in speech or
on paper then she heard his voice saw herself living under the same
roof with him her life merged into his months and years flew by
against the grey background and nellie saw her future distinctly in all
its details

picture followed picture against the grey background now nellie saw
herself one winter night knocking at the door of stepan lukitch the
district doctor the old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate
the doctors windows were in darkness all was silence

for gods sake for gods sake whispered nellie

but at last the garden gate creaked and nellie saw the doctors cook

is the doctor at home

his honours asleep whispered the cook into her sleeve as though
afraid of waking her master

hes only just got home from his fever patients and gave orders he was
not to be waked

but nellie scarcely heard the cook thrusting her aside she rushed
headlong into the doctors house running through some dark and stuffy
rooms upsetting two or three chairs she at last reached the doctors
bedroom stepan lukitch was lying on his bed dressed but without his
coat and with pouting lips was breathing into his open hand a little
nightlight glimmered faintly beside him without uttering a word nellie
sat down and began to cry she wept bitterly shaking all over

my husband is ill she sobbed out stepan lukitch was silent he
slowly sat up propped his head on his hand and looked at his visitor
with fixed sleepy eyes my husband is ill nellie continued
restraining her sobs for mercys sake come quickly make haste   
make haste

eh growled the doctor blowing into his hand

come come this very minute or    its terrible to think for
mercys sake

and pale exhausted nellie gasping and swallowing her tears began
describing to the doctor her husbands illness her unutterable terror
her sufferings would have touched the heart of a stone but the doctor
looked at her blew into his open hand andnot a movement

ill come tomorrow he muttered

thats impossible cried nellie i know my husband has typhus at
once    this very minute you are needed

i    er    have only just come in muttered the doctor for the
last three days ive been away seeing typhus patients and im
exhausted and ill myself    i simply cant absolutely ive caught
it myself there

and the doctor thrust before her eyes a clinical thermometer

my temperature is nearly forty    i absolutely cant i can
scarcely sit up excuse me ill lie down   

the doctor lay down

but i implore you doctor nellie moaned in despair i beseech you
help me for mercys sake make a great effort and come i will repay
you doctor

oh dear    why i have told you already ah

nellie leapt up and walked nervously up and down the bedroom she longed
to explain to the doctor to bring him to reason    she thought if
only he knew how dear her husband was to her and how unhappy she was he
would forget his exhaustion and his illness but how could she be
eloquent enough

go to the zemstvo doctor she heard stepan lukitchs voice

thats impossible he lives more than twenty miles from here and time
is precious and the horses cant stand it it is thirty miles from us
to you and as much from here to the zemstvo doctor no its
impossible come along stepan lukitch i ask of you an heroic deed
come perform that heroic deed have pity on us

its beyond everything    im in a fever    my heads in a whirl
   and she wont understand leave me alone

but you are in duty bound to come you cannot refuse to come its
egoism a man is bound to sacrifice his life for his neighbour and you
   you refuse to come i will summon you before the court

nellie felt that she was uttering a false and undeserved insult but for
her husbands sake she was capable of forgetting logic tact sympathy
for others    in reply to her threats the doctor greedily gulped a
glass of cold water nellie fell to entreating and imploring like the
very lowest beggar    at last the doctor gave way he slowly got up
puffing and panting looking for his coat

here it is cried nellie helping him let me put it on to you come
along i will repay you    all my life i shall be grateful to you 
 

but what agony after putting on his coat the doctor lay down again
nellie got him up and dragged him to the hall then there was an
agonizing todo over his goloshes his overcoat    his cap was lost
   but at last nellie was in the carriage with the doctor now they
had only to drive thirty miles and her husband would have a doctors
help the earth was wrapped in darkness one could not see ones hand
before ones face    a cold winter wind was blowing there were
frozen lumps under their wheels the coachman was continually stopping
and wondering which road to take

nellie and the doctor sat silent all the way it was fearfully jolting
but they felt neither the cold nor the jolts

get on get on nellie implored the driver

at five in the morning the exhausted horses drove into the yard nellie
saw the familiar gates the well with the crane the long row of stables
and barns at last she was at home

wait a moment i will be back directly she said to stepan lukitch
making him sit down on the sofa in the diningroom sit still and wait
a little and ill see how he is going on

on her return from her husband nellie found the doctor lying down he
was lying on the sofa and muttering

doctor please    doctor

eh ask domna muttered stepan lukitch

what

they said at the meeting    vlassov said    who    what

and to her horror nellie saw that the doctor was as delirious as her
husband what was to be done

i must go for the zemstvo doctor she decided

then again there followed darkness a cutting cold wind lumps of frozen
earth she was suffering in body and in soul and delusive nature has no
arts no deceptions to compensate these sufferings   

then she saw against the grey background how her husband every spring
was in straits for money to pay the interest for the mortgage to the
bank he could not sleep she could not sleep and both racked their
brains till their heads ached thinking how to avoid being visited by
the clerk of the court

she saw her children the everlasting apprehension of colds scarlet
fever diphtheria bad marks at school separation out of a brood of
five or six one was sure to die

the grey background was not untouched by death that might well be a
husband and wife cannot die simultaneously whatever happened one must
bury the other and nellie saw her husband dying this terrible event
presented itself to her in every detail she saw the coffin the
candles the deacon and even the footmarks in the hall made by the
undertaker

why is it what is it for she asked looking blankly at her husbands
face

and all the previous life with her husband seemed to her a stupid
prelude to this

something fell from nellies hand and knocked on the floor she started
jumped up and opened her eyes wide one lookingglass she saw lying at
her feet the other was standing as before on the table

she looked into the lookingglass and saw a pale tearstained face
there was no grey background now

i must have fallen asleep she thought with a sigh of relief
