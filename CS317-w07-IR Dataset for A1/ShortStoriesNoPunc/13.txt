minds in ferment from the annals of a town

the earth was like an oven the afternoon sun blazed with such energy
that even the thermometer hanging in the excise officers room lost its
head it ran up to  and stopped there irresolute the inhabitants
streamed with perspiration like overdriven horses and were too lazy to
mop their faces

two of the inhabitants were walking along the marketplace in front of
the closely shuttered houses one was potcheshihin the local treasury
clerk and the other was optimov the agent for many years a
correspondent of the son of the fatherland newspaper they walked in
silence speechless from the heat optimov felt tempted to find fault
with the local authorities for the dust and disorder of the market
place but aware of the peaceloving disposition and moderate views of
his companion he said nothing

in the middle of the marketplace potcheshihin suddenly halted and began
gazing into the sky

what are you looking at

those starlings that flew up i wonder where they have settled clouds
and clouds of them    if one were to go and take a shot at them and
if one were to pick them up    and if    they have settled in the
father prebendarys garden

oh no they are not in the father prebendarys they are in the father
deacons if you did have a shot at them from here you wouldnt kill
anything fine shot wont carry so far it loses its force and why
should you kill them anyway theyre birds destructive of the fruit
thats true still theyre fowls of the air works of the lord the
starling sings you know    and what does it sing pray a song of
praise    all ye fowls of the air praise ye the lord no i do
believe they have settled in the father prebendarys garden

three old pilgrim women wearing bark shoes and carrying wallets passed
noiselessly by the speakers looking enquiringly at the gentlemen who
were for some unknown reason staring at the father prebendarys house
they slackened their pace and when they were a few yards off stopped
glanced at the friends once more and then fell to gazing at the house
themselves

yes you were right they have settled in the father prebendarys
said optimov his cherries are ripe now so they have gone there to
peck them

from the garden gate emerged the father prebendary himself accompanied
by the sexton seeing the attention directed upon his abode and
wondering what people were staring at he stopped and he too as well
as the sexton began looking upwards to find out

the father is going to a service somewhere i suppose said
potcheshihin the lord be his succour

some workmen from purovs factory who had been bathing in the river
passed between the friends and the priest seeing the latter absorbed in
contemplation of the heavens and the pilgrim women too standing
motionless with their eyes turned upwards they stood still and stared
in the same direction

a small boy leading a blind beggar and a peasant carrying a tub of
stinking fish to throw into the marketplace did the same

there must be something the matter i should think said potcheshihin
a fire or something but theres no sign of smoke anywhere hey
kuzma he shouted to the peasant whats the matter

the peasant made some reply but potcheshihin and optimov did not catch
it sleepylooking shopmen made their appearance at the doors of all the
shops some plasterers at work on a warehouse near left their ladders
and joined the workmen

the fireman who was describing circles with his bare feet on the
watchtower halted and after looking steadily at them for a few
minutes came down the watchtower was left deserted this seemed
suspicious

there must be a fire somewhere dont shove me you damned swine

where do you see the fire what fire pass on gentlemen i ask you
civilly

it must be a fire indoors

asks us civilly and keeps poking with his elbows keep your hands to
yourself though you are a head constable you have no sort of right to
make free with your fists

hes trodden on my corn ah ill crush you

crushed whos crushed lads a mans been crushed

whats the meaning of this crowd what do you want

a mans been crushed please your honour

where pass on i ask you civilly i ask you civilly you blockheads

you may shove a peasant but you darent touch a gentleman hands off

did you ever know such people theres no doing anything with them by
fair words the devils sidorov run for akim danilitch look sharp
itll be the worse for you gentlemen akim danilitch is coming and
hell give it to you you here parfen a blind man and at his age too
cant see but he must be like other people and wont do what hes told
smirnov put his name down

yes sir and shall i write down the men from purovs that man there
with the swollen cheek hes from purovs works

dont put down the men from purovs its purovs birthday tomorrow

the starlings rose in a black cloud from the father prebendarys garden
but potcheshihin and optimov did not notice them they stood staring
into the air wondering what could have attracted such a crowd and what
it was looking at

akim danilitch appeared still munching and wiping his lips he cut his
way into the crowd bellowing

firemen be ready disperse mr optimov disperse or itll be the
worse for you instead of writing all kinds of things about decent
people in the papers you had better try to behave yourself more
conformably no good ever comes of reading the papers

kindly refrain from reflections upon literature cried optimov hotly
i am a literary man and i will allow no one to make reflections upon
literature though as is the duty of a citizen i respect you as a
father and benefactor

firemen turn the hose on them

theres no water please your honour

dont answer me go and get some look sharp

weve nothing to get it in your honour the major has taken the fire
brigade horses to drive his aunt to the station

disperse stand back damnation take you is that to your taste put
him down the devil

ive lost my pencil please your honour

the crowd grew larger and larger there is no telling what proportions
it might have reached if the new organ just arrived from moscow had not
fortunately begun playing in the tavern close by hearing their
favourite tune the crowd gasped and rushed off to the tavern so nobody
ever knew why the crowd had assembled and potcheshihin and optimov had
by now forgotten the existence of the starlings who were innocently
responsible for the proceedings

an hour later the town was still and silent again and only a solitary
figure was to be seenthe fireman pacing round and round on the watch
tower

the same evening akim danilitch sat in the grocers shop drinking
limonade gaseuse and brandy and writing

in addition to the official report i venture your excellency to
append a few supplementary observations of my own father and
benefactor in very truth but for the prayers of your virtuous spouse
in her salubrious villa near our town theres no knowing what might not
have come to pass what i have been through today i can find no words
to express the efficiency of krushensky and of the major of the fire
brigade are beyond all praise i am proud of such devoted servants of
our country as for me i did all that a weak man could do whose only
desire is the welfare of his neighbour and sitting now in the bosom of
my family with tears in my eyes i thank him who spared us bloodshed in
absence of evidence the guilty parties remain in custody but i propose
to release them in a week or so it was their ignorance that led them
astray
