in the dark

a fly of medium size made its way into the nose of the assistant
procurator gagin it may have been impelled by curiosity or have got
there through frivolity or accident in the dark anyway the nose
resented the presence of a foreign body and gave the signal for a
sneeze gagin sneezed sneezed impressively and so shrilly and loudly
that the bed shook and the springs creaked gagins wife marya
mihalovna a full plump fair woman started too and woke up she
gazed into the darkness sighed and turned over on the other side five
minutes afterwards she turned over again and shut her eyes more firmly
but she could not get to sleep again after sighing and tossing from
side to side for a time she got up crept over her husband and putting
on her slippers went to the window

it was dark outside she could see nothing but the outlines of the trees
and the roof of the stables there was a faint pallor in the east but
this pallor was beginning to be clouded over there was perfect
stillness in the air wrapped in slumber and darkness even the watchman
paid to disturb the stillness of night was silent even the
corncrakethe only wild creature of the feathered tribe that does not
shun the proximity of summer visitorswas silent

the stillness was broken by marya mihalovna herself standing at the
window and gazing into the yard she suddenly uttered a cry she fancied
that from the flower garden with the gaunt clipped poplar a dark
figure was creeping towards the house for the first minute she thought
it was a cow or a horse then rubbing her eyes she distinguished
clearly the outlines of a man

then she fancied the dark figure approached the window of the kitchen
and standing still a moment apparently undecided put one foot on the
window ledge and disappeared into the darkness of the window

a burglar flashed into her mind and a deathly pallor overspread her
face

and in one instant her imagination had drawn the picture so dreaded by
lady visitors in country placesa burglar creeps into the kitchen from
the kitchen into the diningroom    the silver in the cupboard   
next into the bedroom    an axe    the face of a brigand   
jewelry    her knees gave way under her and a shiver ran down her
back

vassya she said shaking her husband basile vassily prokovitch
ah mercy on us he might be dead wake up basile i beseech you

wwell grunted the assistant procurator with a deep inward breath
and a munching sound

for gods sake wake up a burglar has got into the kitchen i was
standing at the window looking out and someone got in at the window he
will get into the diningroom next    the spoons are in the cupboard
basile they broke into mavra yegorovnas last year

just seen a man getting in at the kitchen window pelagea will be
frightened and    and the silver is in the cupboard

stuff and nonsense

basile this is unbearable i tell you of a real danger and you sleep
and grunt what would you have would you have us robbed and murdered

the assistant procurator slowly got up and sat on the bed filling the
air with loud yawns

goodness knows what creatures women are he muttered cant leave one
in peace even at night to wake a man for such nonsense

but basile i swear i saw a man getting in at the window

well what of it let him get in    thats pretty sure to be
pelageas sweetheart the fireman

worse than ever shrieked marya mihalovna thats worse than a
burglar i wont put up with cynicism in my house

hoitytoity we are virtuous    wont put up with cynicism as
though it were cynicism whats the use of firing off those foreign
words my dear girl its a thing that has happened ever since the world
began sanctified by tradition whats a fireman for if not to make love
to the cook

no basile it seems you dont know me i cannot face the idea of such
a    such a    in my house you must go this minute into the
kitchen and tell him to go away this very minute and tomorrow ill
tell pelagea that she must not dare to demean herself by such
proceedings when i am dead you may allow immorality in your house but
you shant do it now    please go

damn it grumbled gagin annoyed consider with your microscopic
female brain what am i to go for

basile i shall faint   

gagin cursed put on his slippers cursed again and set off to the
kitchen it was as dark as the inside of a barrel and the assistant
procurator had to feel his way he groped his way to the door of the
nursery and waked the nurse

vassilissa he said you took my dressinggown to brush last
nightwhere is it

i gave it to pelagea to brush sir

what carelessness you take it away and dont put it backnow ive to
go without a dressinggown

on reaching the kitchen he made his way to the corner in which on a box
under a shelf of saucepans the cook slept

pelagea he said feeling her shoulder and giving it a shake
pelagea why are you pretending you are not asleep who was it got in
at your window just now

mm    m    good morning got in at the window who could get in

oh come its no use your trying to keep it up youd better tell your
scamp to clear out while he can do you hear hes no business to be
here

are you out of your senses sir bless you do you think id be such a
fool here ones running about all day long never a minute to sit down
and then spoken to like this at night four roubles a month    and to
find my own tea and sugar and this is all the credit i get for it i
used to live in a tradesmans house and never met with such insult
there

come comeno need to go over your grievances this very minute your
grenadier must turn out do you understand

you ought to be ashamed sir said pelagea and he could hear the
tears in her voice gentlefolks    educated and yet not a notion
that with our hard lot    in our life of toilshe burst into tears
its easy to insult us theres no one to stand up for us

come come    i dont mind your mistress sent me you may let a
devil in at the window for all i care

there was nothing left for the assistant procurator but to acknowledge
himself in the wrong and go back to his spouse

i say pelagea he said you had my dressinggown to brush where is
it

oh i am so sorry sir i forgot to put it on your chair its hanging
on a peg near the stove

gagin felt for the dressinggown by the stove put it on and went
quietly back to his room

when her husband went out marya mihalovna got into bed and waited for
the first three minutes her mind was at rest but after that she began
to feel uneasy

what a long time hes gone she thought its all right if he is
there    that immoral man    but if its a burglar

and again her imagination drew a picture of her husband going into the
dark kitchen    a blow with an axe    dying without uttering a
single sound    a pool of blood   

five minutes passed    five and a half    at last six    a
cold sweat came out on her forehead

basile she shrieked basile

what are you shouting for i am here she heard her husbands voice
and steps are you being murdered

the assistant procurator went up to the bedstead and sat down on the
edge of it

theres nobody there at all he said it was your fancy you queer
creature    you can sleep easy your fool of a pelagea is as
virtuous as her mistress what a coward you are what a    

and the deputy procurator began teasing his wife he was wide awake now
and did not want to go to sleep again

you are a coward he laughed youd better go to the doctor tomorrow
and tell him about your hallucinations you are a neurotic

what a smell of tar said his wifetar or something    onion   
cabbage soup

yyes there is a smell    i am not sleepy i say ill light the
candle    where are the matches and by the way ill show you the
photograph of the procurator of the palace of justice he gave us all a
photograph when he said goodbye to us yesterday with his autograph

gagin struck a match against the wall and lighted a candle but before
he had moved a step from the bed to fetch the photographs he heard
behind him a piercing heartrending shriek looking round he saw his
wifes large eyes fastened upon him full of amazement horror and
wrath   

you took your dressinggown off in the kitchen she said turning
pale

why

look at yourself

the deputy procurator looked down at himself and gasped

flung over his shoulders was not his dressinggown but the firemans
overcoat how had it come on his shoulders while he was settling that
question his wifes imagination was drawing another picture awful and
impossible darkness stillness whispering and so on and so on
