an actors end

shtchiptsov the heavy father and goodhearted simpleton a tall and
thickset old man not so much distinguished by his talents as an actor
as by his exceptional physical strength had a desperate quarrel with
the manager during the performance and just when the storm of words was
at its height felt as though something had snapped in his chest zhukov
the manager as a rule began at the end of every heated discussion to
laugh hysterically and to fall into a swoon on this occasion however
shtchiptsov did not remain for this climax but hurried home the high
words and the sensation of something ruptured in his chest so agitated
him as he left the theatre that he forgot to wash off his paint and did
nothing but take off his beard

when he reached his hotel room shtchiptsov spent a long time pacing up
and down then sat down on the bed propped his head on his fists and
sank into thought he sat like that without stirring or uttering a sound
till two oclock the next afternoon when sigaev the comic man walked
into his room

why is it you did not come to the rehearsal booby ivanitch the comic
man began panting and filling the room with fumes of vodka where have
you been

shtchiptsov made no answer but simply stared at the comic man with
lustreless eyes under which there were smudges of paint

you might at least have washed your phiz sigaev went on you are a
disgraceful sight have you been boozing or    are you ill or what
but why dont you speak i am asking you are you ill

shtchiptsov did not speak in spite of the paint on his face the comic
man could not help noticing his striking pallor the drops of sweat on
his forehead and the twitching of his lips his hands and feet were
trembling too and the whole huge figure of the goodnatured simpleton
looked somehow crushed and flattened the comic man took a rapid glance
round the room but saw neither bottle nor flask nor any other
suspicious vessel

i say mishutka you know you are ill he said in a flutter strike
me dead you are ill you dont look yourself

shtchiptsov remained silent and stared disconsolately at the floor

you must have caught cold said sigaev taking him by the hand oh
dear how hot your hands are whats the trouble

i waant to go home muttered shtchiptsov

but you are at home now arent you

no    to vyazma   

oh my anywhere else it would take you three years to get to your
vyazma    what do you want to go and see your daddy and mummy ill
be bound theyve kicked the bucket years ago and you wont find their
graves   

my hoomes there

come its no good giving way to the dismal dumps these neurotic
feelings are the limit old man you must get well for you have to play
mitka in the terrible tsar tomorrow there is nobody else to do it
drink something hot and take some castoroil have you got the money for
some castoroil or stay ill run and buy some

the comic man fumbled in his pockets found a fifteenkopeck piece and
ran to the chemists a quarter of an hour later he came back

come drink it he said holding the bottle to the heavy fathers
mouth drink it straight out of the bottle    all at a go thats
the way    now nibble at a clove that your very soul maynt stink of
the filthy stuff

the comic man sat a little longer with his sick friend then kissed him
tenderly and went away towards evening the jeune premier brama
glinsky ran in to see shtchiptsov the gifted actor was wearing a pair
of prunella boots had a glove on his left hand was smoking a cigar
and even smelt of heliotrope yet nevertheless he strongly suggested a
traveller cast away in some land in which there were neither baths nor
laundresses nor tailors   

i hear you are ill he said to shtchiptsov twirling round on his
heel whats wrong with you whats wrong with you really   

shtchiptsov did not speak nor stir

why dont you speak do you feel giddy oh well dont talk i wont
pester you    dont talk   

bramaglinsky that was his stage name in his passport he was called
guskov walked away to the window put his hands in his pockets and
fell to gazing into the street before his eyes stretched an immense
waste bounded by a grey fence beside which ran a perfect forest of last
years burdocks beyond the waste ground was a dark deserted factory
with windows boarded up a belated jackdaw was flying round the chimney
this dreary lifeless scene was beginning to be veiled in the dusk of
evening

i must go home the jeune premier heard

where is home

to vyazma    to my home   

it is a thousand miles to vyazma    my boy sighed bramaglinsky
drumming on the windowpane and what do you want to go to vyazma for

i want to die there

what next now hes dying he has fallen ill for the first time in his
life and already he fancies that his last hour is come    no my
boy no cholera will carry off a buffalo like you youll live to be a
hundred    wheres the pain

theres no pain but i    feel   

you dont feel anything it all comes from being too healthy your
surplus energy upsets you you ought to get jolly tightdrink you know
till your whole inside is topsyturvy getting drunk is wonderfully
restoring    do you remember how screwed you were at rostov on the
don good lord the very thought of it is alarming sashka and i
together could only just carry in the barrel and you emptied it alone
and even sent for rum afterwards    you got so drunk you were
catching devils in a sack and pulled a lamppost up by the roots do you
remember then you went off to beat the greeks   

under the influence of these agreeable reminiscences shtchiptsovs face
brightened a little and his eyes began to shine

and do you remember how i beat savoikin the manager he muttered
raising his head but there ive beaten thirtythree managers in my
time and i cant remember how many smaller fry and what managers they
were men who would not permit the very winds to touch them ive beaten
two celebrated authors and one painter

what are you crying for

at kherson i killed a horse with my fists and at taganrog some roughs
fell upon me at night fifteen of them i took off their caps and they
followed me begging uncle give us back our caps thats how i used
to go on

what are you crying for then you silly

but now its all over    i feel it if only i could go to vyazma

a pause followed after a silence shtchiptsov suddenly jumped up and
seized his cap he looked distraught

goodbye i am going to vyazma he articulated staggering

and the money for the journey

hm    i shall go on foot

you are crazy   

the two men looked at each other probably because the same thoughtof
the boundless plains the unending forests and swampsstruck both of
them at once

well i see you have gone off your head the jeune premier commented
ill tell you what old man    first thing go to bed then drink
some brandy and tea to put you into a sweat and some castoroil of
course stay where am i to get some brandy

bramaglinsky thought a minute then made up his mind to go to a
shopkeeper called madame tsitrinnikov to try and get it from her on
tick who knows perhaps the woman would feel for them and let them have
it the jeune premier went off and half an hour later returned with a
bottle of brandy and some castoroil shtchiptsov was sitting
motionless as before on the bed gazing dumbly at the floor he drank
the castoroil offered him by his friend like an automaton with no
consciousness of what he was doing like an automaton he sat afterwards
at the table and drank tea and brandy mechanically he emptied the
whole bottle and let the jeune premier put him to bed the latter
covered him up with a quilt and an overcoat advised him to get into a
perspiration and went away

the night came on shtchiptsov had drunk a great deal of brandy but he
did not sleep he lay motionless under the quilt and stared at the dark
ceiling then seeing the moon looking in at the window he turned his
eyes from the ceiling towards the companion of the earth and lay so
with open eyes till the morning at nine oclock in the morning zhukov
the manager ran in

what has put it into your head to be ill my angel he cackled
wrinkling up his nose aie aie a man with your physique has no
business to be ill for shame for shame do you know i was quite
frightened can our conversation have had such an effect on him i
wondered my dear soul i hope its not through me youve fallen ill
you know you gave me as good    er    and besides comrades can
never get on without words you called me all sorts of names    and
have gone at me with your fists too and yet i am fond of you upon my
soul i am i respect you and am fond of you explain my angel why i
am so fond of you you are neither kith nor kin nor wife but as soon as
i heard you had fallen ill it cut me to the heart

zhukov spent a long time declaring his affection then fell to kissing
the invalid and finally was so overcome by his feelings that he began
laughing hysterically and was even meaning to fall into a swoon but
probably remembering that he was not at home nor at the theatre put off
the swoon to a more convenient opportunity and went away

soon after him adabashev the tragic actor a dingy shortsighted
individual who talked through his nose made his appearance    for a
long while he looked at shtchiptsov for a long while he pondered and
at last he made a discovery

do you know what mifa he said pronouncing through his nose f
instead of sh and assuming a mysterious expression do you know
what you ought to have a dose of castoroil

shtchiptsov was silent he remained silent too a little later as the
tragic actor poured the loathsome oil into his mouth two hours later
yevlampy or as the actors for some reason called him rigoletto the
hairdresser of the company came into the room he too like the tragic
man stared at shtchiptsov for a long time then sighed like a steam
engine and slowly and deliberately began untying a parcel he had
brought with him in it there were twenty cups and several little
flasks

you should have sent for me and i would have cupped you long ago he
said tenderly baring shtchiptsovs chest it is easy to neglect
illness

thereupon rigoletto stroked the broad chest of the heavy father and
covered it all over with suction cups

yes    he said as after this operation he packed up his
paraphernalia crimson with shtchiptsovs blood you should have sent
for me and i would have come    you neednt trouble about payment
   i do it from sympathy where are you to get the money if that idol
wont pay you now please take these drops they are nice drops and
now you must have a dose of this castoroil its the real thing thats
right i hope it will do you good well now goodbye   

rigoletto took his parcel and withdrew pleased that he had been of
assistance to a fellowcreature

the next morning sigaev the comic man going in to see shtchiptsov
found him in a terrible condition he was lying under his coat
breathing in gasps while his eyes strayed over the ceiling in his
hands he was crushing convulsively the crumpled quilt

to vyazma he whispered when he saw the comic man to vyazma

come i dont like that old man said the comic man flinging up his
hands you see    you see    you see old man thats not the
thing excuse me but    its positively stupid   

to go to vyazma my god to vyazma

i    i did not expect it of you the comic man muttered utterly
distracted what the deuce do you want to collapse like this for aie 
  aie    aie    thats not the thing a giant as tall as a
watchtower and crying is it the thing for actors to cry

no wife nor children muttered shtchiptsov i ought not to have gone
for an actor but have stayed at vyazma my life has been wasted
semyon oh to be in vyazma

aie    aie    aie    thats not the thing you see its
stupid    contemptible indeed

recovering his composure and setting his feelings in order sigaev began
comforting shtchiptsov telling him untruly that his comrades had
decided to send him to the crimea at their expense and so on but the
sick man did not listen and kept muttering about vyazma     at last
with a wave of his hand the comic man began talking about vyazma
himself to comfort the invalid

its a fine town he said soothingly a capital town old man its
famous for its cakes the cakes are classical butbetween
ourselveshmthey are a bit groggy for a whole week after eating them
i was    hm    but what is fine there is the merchants they are
something like merchants when they treat you they do treat you

the comic man talked while shtchiptsov listened in silence and nodded
his head approvingly

towards evening he died
