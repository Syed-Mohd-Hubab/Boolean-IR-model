in a strange land

sunday midday a landowner called kamyshev is sitting in his dining 
room deliberately eating his lunch at a luxuriously furnished table
monsieur champoun a clean neat smoothly shaven old frenchman is
sharing the meal with him this champoun had once been a tutor in
kamyshevs household had taught his children good manners the correct
pronunciation of french and dancing afterwards when kamyshevs
children had grown up and become lieutenants champoun had become
something like a bonne of the male sex the duties of the former tutor
were not complicated he had to be properly dressed to smell of scent
to listen to kamyshevs idle babble to eat and drink and sleep and
apparently that was all for this he received a room his board and an
indefinite salary

kamyshev eats and as usual babbles at random

damnation he says wiping away the tears that have come into his eyes
after a mouthful of ham thickly smeared with mustard ough it has shot
into my head and all my joints your french mustard would not do that
you know if you ate the whole potful

some like the french some prefer the russian   champoun assents
mildly

no one likes french mustard except frenchmen and a frenchman will eat
anything whatever you give him frogs and rats and black beetles  
brrr you dont like that ham for instance because it is russian but
if one were to give you a bit of baked glass and tell you it was french
you would eat it and smack your lips    to your thinking everything
russian is nasty

i dont say that

everything russian is nasty but if its french o say tray zholee to
your thinking there is no country better than france but to my mind 
 why what is france to tell the truth about it a little bit of land
our police captain was sent out there but in a month he asked to be
transferred there was nowhere to turn round one can drive round the
whole of your france in one day while here when you drive out of the
gate you can see no end to the land you can ride on and on  

yes monsieur russia is an immense country

to be sure it is to your thinking there are no better people than the
french well educated clever people civilization i agree the french
are all well educated with elegant manners   that is true    a
frenchman never allows himself to be rude he hands a lady a chair at
the right minute he doesnt eat crayfish with his fork he doesnt spit
on the floor but    theres not the same spirit in him not the
spirit in him i dont know how to explain it to you but however one is
to express it theres nothing in a frenchman of    something   
the speaker flourishes his fingers    of something    fanatical
i remember i have read somewhere that all of you have intelligence
acquired from books while we russians have innate intelligence if a
russian studies the sciences properly none of your french professors is
a match for him

perhaps says champoun as it were reluctantly

no not perhaps but certainly its no use your frowning its the
truth i am speaking the russian intelligence is an inventive
intelligence only of course he is not given a free outlet for it and
he is no hand at boasting he will invent something and break it or give
it to the children to play with while your frenchman will invent some
nonsensical thing and make an uproar for all the world to hear it the
other day iona the coachman carved a little man out of wood if you pull
the little man by a thread he plays unseemly antics but iona does not
brag of it    i dont like frenchmen as a rule i am not referring
to you but speaking generally    they are an immoral people
outwardly they look like men but they live like dogs take marriage for
instance with us once you are married you stick to your wife and
there is no talk about it but goodness knows how it is with you the
husband is sitting all day long in a caf while his wife fills the
house with frenchmen and sets to dancing the can can with them

thats not true champoun protests flaring up and unable to restrain
himself the principle of the family is highly esteemed in france

we know all about that principle you ought to be ashamed to defend it
one ought to be impartial a pig is always a pig    we must thank
the germans for having beaten them    yes indeed god bless them for
it

in that case monsieur i dont understand   says the frenchman
leaping up with flashing eyes if you hate the french why do you keep
me

what am i to do with you

let me go and i will go back to france

wha at but do you suppose they would let you into france now why you
are a traitor to your country at one time napoleons your great man at
another gambetta    who the devil can make you out

monsieur says champoun in french spluttering and crushing up his
table napkin in his hands my worst enemy could not have thought of a
greater insult than the outrage you have just done to my feelings all
is over

and with a tragic wave of his arm the frenchman flings his dinner napkin
on the table majestically and walks out of the room with dignity

three hours later the table is laid again and the servants bring in the
dinner kamyshev sits alone at the table after the preliminary glass he
feels a craving to babble he wants to chatter but he has no listener

what is alphonse ludovikovitch doing he asks the footman

he is packing his trunk sir

what a noodle lord forgive us says kamyshev and goes in to the
frenchman

champoun is sitting on the floor in his room and with trembling hands
is packing in his trunk his linen scent bottles prayer books braces
ties    all his correct figure his trunk his bedstead and the
table all have an air of elegance and effeminacy great tears are
dropping from his big blue eyes into the trunk

where are you off to asks kamyshev after standing still for a
little

the frenchman says nothing

do you want to go away kamyshev goes on well you know but    i
wont venture to detain you but what is queer is how are you going to
travel without a passport i wonder you know i have lost your passport
i thrust it in somewhere between some papers and it is lost    and
they are strict about passports among us before you have gone three or
four miles they pounce upon you

champoun raises his head and looks mistrustfully at kamyshev

yes    you will see they will see from your face you havent a
passport and ask at once who is that alphonse champoun we know that
alphonse champoun wouldnt you like to go under police escort somewhere
nearer home

are you joking

what motive have i for joking why should i only mind now its a
compact dont you begin whining then and writing letters i wont stir
a finger when they lead you by in fetters

champoun jumps up and pale and wide eyed begins pacing up and down the
room

what are you doing to me he says in despair clutching at his head
my god accursed be that hour when the fatal thought of leaving my
country entered my head   

come come come    i was joking says kamyshev in a lower tone
queer fish he is he doesnt understand a joke one cant say a word

my dear friend shrieks champoun reassured by kamyshevs tone i
swear i am devoted to russia to you and your children    to leave
you is as bitter to me as death itself but every word you utter stabs
me to the heart

ah you queer fish if i do abuse the french what reason have you to
take offence you are a queer fish really you should follow the example
of lazar isaakitch my tenant i call him one thing and another a jew
and a scurvy rascal and i make a pigs ear out of my coat tail and
catch him by his jewish curls he doesnt take offence

but he is a slave for a kopeck he is ready to put up with any insult

come come come    thats enough peace and concord

champoun powders his tear stained face and goes with kamyshev to the
dining room the first course is eaten in silence after the second the
same performance begins over again and so champouns sufferings have no
end
