a mystery

on the evening of easter sunday the actual civil councillor navagin on
his return from paying calls picked up the sheet of paper on which
visitors had inscribed their names in the hall and went with it into
his study after taking off his outer garments and drinking some seltzer
water he settled himself comfortably on a couch and began reading the
signatures in the list when his eyes reached the middle of the long
list of signatures he started gave an ejaculation of astonishment and
snapped his fingers while his face expressed the utmost perplexity

again he said slapping his knee its extraordinary again again
there is the signature of that fellow goodness knows who he is
fedyukov again

among the numerous signatures on the paper was the signature of a
certain fedyukov who the devil this fedyukov was navagin had not a
notion he went over in his memory all his acquaintances relations and
subordinates in the service recalled his remote past but could
recollect no name like fedyukov what was so strange was that this
incognito fedyukov had signed his name regularly every christmas and
easter for the last thirteen years neither navagin his wife nor his
house porter knew who he was where he came from or what he was like

its extraordinary navagin thought in perplexity as he paced about
the study its strange and incomprehensible its like sorcery

call the porter here he shouted

its devilish queer but i will find out who he is

i say grigory he said addressing the porter as he entered that
fedyukov has signed his name again did you see him

no your excellency

upon my word but he has signed his name so he must have been in the
hall has he been

no he hasnt your excellency

how could he have signed his name without being there

i cant tell

who is to tell then you sit gaping there in the hall try and
remember perhaps someone you didnt know came in think a minute

no your excellency there has been no one i didnt know our clerks
have been the baroness came to see her excellency the priests have
been with the cross and there has been no one else   

why he was invisible when he signed his name then was he

i cant say but there has been no fedyukov here that i will swear
before the holy image   

its queer its incomprehensible its ex traordinary mused navagin
its positively ludicrous a man has been signing his name here for
thirteen years and you cant find out who he is perhaps its a joke
perhaps some clerk writes that name as well as his own for fun

and navagin began examining fedyukovs signature

the bold florid signature in the old fashioned style with twirls and
flourishes was utterly unlike the handwriting of the other signatures
it was next below the signature of shtutchkin the provincial secretary
a scared timorous little man who would certainly have died of fright if
he had ventured upon such an impudent joke

the mysterious fedyukov has signed his name again said navagin going
in to see his wife again i fail to find out who he is

madame navagin was a spiritualist and so for all phenomena in nature
comprehensible or incomprehensible she had a very simple explanation

theres nothing extraordinary about it she said you dont believe
it of course but i have said it already and i say it again there is a
great deal in the world that is supernatural which our feeble intellect
can never grasp i am convinced that this fedyukov is a spirit who has a
sympathy for you    if i were you i would call him up and ask him
what he wants

nonsense nonsense

navagin was free from superstitions but the phenomenon which interested
him was so mysterious that all sorts of uncanny devilry intruded into
his mind against his will all the evening he was imagining that the
incognito fedyukov was the spirit of some long dead clerk who had been
discharged from the service by navagins ancestors and was now revenging
himself on their descendant or perhaps it was the kinsman of some petty
official dismissed by navagin himself or of a girl seduced by him  


all night navagin dreamed of a gaunt old clerk in a shabby uniform with
a face as yellow as a lemon hair that stood up like a brush and
pewtery eyes the clerk said something in a sepulchral voice and shook a
bony finger at him and navagin almost had an attack of inflammation of
the brain

for a fortnight he was silent and gloomy and kept walking up and down
and thinking in the end he overcame his sceptical vanity and going
into his wifes room he said in a hollow voice

zina call up fedyukov

the spiritualistic lady was delighted she sent for a sheet of cardboard
and a saucer made her husband sit down beside her and began upon the
magic rites

fedyukov did not keep them waiting long   

what do you want asked navagin

repent answered the saucer

what were you on earth

a sinner   

there you see whispered his wife and you did not believe

navagin conversed for a long time with fedyukov and then called up
napoleon hannibal askotchensky his aunt klavdya zaharovna and they
all gave him brief but correct answers full of deep significance he was
busy with the saucer for four hours and fell asleep soothed and happy
that he had become acquainted with a mysterious world that was new to
him after that he studied spiritualism every day and at the office
informed the clerks that there was a great deal in nature that was
supernatural and marvellous to which our men of science ought to have
turned their attention long ago

hypnotism mediumism bishopism spiritualism the fourth dimension and
other misty notions took complete possession of him so that for whole
days at a time to the great delight of his wife he read books on
spiritualism or devoted himself to the saucer table turning and
discussions of supernatural phenomena at his instigation all his clerks
took up spiritualism too and with such ardour that the old managing
clerk went out of his mind and one day sent a telegram hell
government house i feel that i am turning into an evil spirit whats
to be done reply paid vassily krinolinsky

after reading several hundreds of treatises on spiritualism navagin had
a strong desire to write something himself for five months he sat
composing and in the end had written a huge monograph entitled my
opinion when he had finished this essay he determined to send it to a
spiritualist journal

the day on which it was intended to despatch it to the journal was a
very memorable one for him navagin remembers that on that never to be 
forgotten day the secretary who had made a fair copy of his article and
the sacristan of the parish who had been sent for on business were in
his study navagins face was beaming he looked lovingly at his
creation felt between his fingers how thick it was and with a happy
smile said to the secretary

i propose filipp sergeyitch to send it registered it will be safer
   and raising his eyes to the sacristan he said i have sent for
you on business my good man i am putting my youngest son to the high
school and i must have a certificate of baptism only could you let me
have it quickly

very good your excellency said the sacristan bowing very good i
understand   

can you let me have it by to morrow

very well your excellency set your mind at rest to morrow it shall
be ready will you send someone to the church to morrow before evening
service i shall be there bid him ask for fedyukov i am always there
  

what cried the general turning pale

fedyukov

you    you are fedyukov asked navagin looking at him with wide 
open eyes

just so fedyukov

you    you signed your name in my hall

yes    the sacristan admitted and was overcome with confusion
when we come with the cross your excellency to grand gentlemens
houses i always sign my name    i like doing it    excuse me
but when i see the list of names in the hall i feel an impulse to sign
mine   

in dumb stupefaction understanding nothing hearing nothing navagin
paced about his study he touched the curtain over the door three times
waved his hands like a jeune premier in a ballet when he sees her gave
a whistle and a meaningless smile and pointed with his finger into
space

so i will send off the article at once your excellency said the
secretary

these words roused navagin from his stupour he looked blankly at the
secretary and the sacristan remembered and stamping his foot
irritably screamed in a high breaking tenor

leave me in peace lea eave me in peace i tell you what you want of
me i dont understand

the secretary and the sacristan went out of the study and reached the
street while he was still stamping and shouting

leave me in peace what you want of me i dont understand lea eave me
in peace
