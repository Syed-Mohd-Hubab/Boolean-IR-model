in the court

at the district town of n in the cinnamon coloured government house in
which the zemstvo the sessional meetings of the justices of the peace
the rural board the liquor board the military board and many others
sit by turns the circuit court was in session on one of the dull days
of autumn of the above mentioned cinnamon coloured house a local
official had wittily observed

here is justitia here is policia here is militiaa regular boarding
school of high born young ladies

but as the saying is too many cooks spoil the broth and probably
that is why the house strikes oppresses and overwhelms a fresh
unofficial visitor with its dismal barrack like appearance its decrepit
condition and the complete absence of any kind of comfort external or
internal even on the brightest spring days it seems wrapped in a dense
shade and on clear moonlight nights when the trees and the little
dwelling houses merged in one blur of shadow seem plunged in quiet
slumber it alone absurdly and inappropriately towers an oppressive
mass of stone above the modest landscape spoils the general harmony
and keeps sleepless vigil as though it could not escape from burdensome
memories of past unforgiven sins inside it is like a barn and extremely
unattractive it is strange to see how readily these elegant lawyers
members of committees and marshals of nobility who in their own homes
will make a scene over the slightest fume from the stove or stain on
the floor resign themselves here to whirring ventilation wheels the
disgusting smell of fumigating candles and the filthy forever
perspiring walls

the sitting of the circuit court began between nine and ten the
programme of the day was promptly entered upon with noticeable haste
the cases came on one after another and ended quickly like a church
service without a choir so that no mind could form a complete picture
of all this parti coloured mass of faces movements words misfortunes
true sayings and lies all racing by like a river in flood    by two
oclock a great deal had been done two prisoners had been sentenced to
service in convict battalions one of the privileged class had been
sentenced to deprivation of rights and imprisonment one had been
acquitted one case had been adjourned

at precisely two oclock the presiding judge announced that the case of
the peasant nikolay harlamov charged with the murder of his wife
would next be heard the composition of the court remained the same as
it had been for the preceding case except that the place of the
defending counsel was filled by a new personage a beardless young
graduate in a coat with bright buttons the president gave the
orderbring in the prisoner

but the prisoner who had been got ready beforehand was already walking
to his bench he was a tall thick set peasant of about fifty five
completely bald with an apathetic hairy face and a big red beard he
was followed by a frail looking little soldier with a gun

just as he was reaching the bench the escort had a trifling mishap he
stumbled and dropped the gun out of his hands but caught it at once
before it touched the ground knocking his knee violently against the
butt end as he did so a faint laugh was audible in the audience either
from the pain or perhaps from shame at his awkwardness the soldier
flushed a dark red

after the customary questions to the prisoner the shuffling of the
jury the calling over and swearing in of the witnesses the reading of
the charge began the narrow chested pale faced secretary far too thin
for his uniform and with sticking plaster on his check read it in a
low thick bass rapidly like a sacristan without raising or dropping
his voice as though afraid of exerting his lungs he was seconded by
the ventilation wheel whirring indefatigably behind the judges table
and the result was a sound that gave a drowsy narcotic character to the
stillness of the hall

the president a short sighted man not old but with an extremely
exhausted face sat in his armchair without stirring and held his open
hand near his brow as though screening his eyes from the sun to the
droning of the ventilation wheel and the secretary he meditated when
the secretary paused for an instant to take breath on beginning a new
page he suddenly started and looked round at the court with lustreless
eyes then bent down to the ear of the judge next to him and asked with
a sigh

are you putting up at demyanovs matvey petrovitch

yes at demyanovs answered the other starting too

next time i shall probably put up there too its really impossible to
put up at tipyakovs theres noise and uproar all night knocking
coughing children crying    its impossible

the assistant prosecutor a fat well nourished dark man with gold
spectacles with a handsome well groomed beard sat motionless as a
statue with his cheek propped on his fist reading byrons cain his
eyes were full of eager attention and his eyebrows rose higher and
higher with wonder    from time to time he dropped back in his
chair gazed without interest straight before him for a minute and then
buried himself in his reading again the council for the defence moved
the blunt end of his pencil about the table and mused with his head on
one side    his youthful face expressed nothing but the frigid
immovable boredom which is commonly seen on the face of schoolboys and
men on duty who are forced from day to day to sit in the same place to
see the same faces the same walls he felt no excitement about the
speech he was to make and indeed what did that speech amount to on
instructions from his superiors in accordance with long established
routine he would fire it off before the jurymen without passion or
ardour feeling that it was colourless and boring and thengallop
through the mud and the rain to the station thence to the town shortly
to receive instructions to go off again to some district to deliver
another speech    it was a bore

at first the prisoner turned pale and coughed nervously into his sleeve
but soon the stillness the general monotony and boredom infected him
too he looked with dull witted respectfulness at the judges uniforms
at the weary faces of the jurymen and bblinked calmly the surroundings
and procedure of the court the expectation of which had so weighed on
his soul while he was awaiting them in prison now had the most soothing
effect on him what he met here was not at all what he could have
expected the charge of murder hung over him and yet here he met with
neither threatening faces nor indignant looks nor loud phrases about
retribution nor sympathy for his extraordinary fate not one of those
who were judging him looked at him with interest or for long    the
dingy windows and walls the voice of the secretary the attitude of the
prosecutor were all saturated with official indifference and produced an
atmosphere of frigidity as though the murderer were simply an official
property or as though he were not being judged by living men but by
some unseen machine set going goodness knows how or by whom   

the peasant reassured did not understand that the men here were as
accustomed to the dramas and tragedies of life and were as blunted by
the sight of them as hospital attendants are at the sight of death and
that the whole horror and hopelessness of his position lay just in this
mechanical indifference it seemed that if he were not to sit quietly
but to get up and begin beseeching appealing with tears for their
mercy bitterly repenting that if he were to die of despairit would
all be shattered against blunted nerves and the callousness of custom
like waves against a rock

when the secretary finished the president for some reason passed his
hands over the table before him looked for some time with his eyes
screwed up towards the prisoner and then asked speaking languidly

prisoner at the bar do you plead guilty to having murdered your wife
on the evening of the ninth of june

no sir answered the prisoner getting up and holding his gown over
his chest

after this the court proceeded hurriedly to the examination of
witnesses two peasant women and five men and the village policeman who
had made the enquiry were questioned all of them mud bespattered
exhausted with their long walk and waiting in the witnesses room
gloomy and dispirited gave the same evidence they testified that
harlamov lived well with his old woman like anyone else that he
never beat her except when he had had a drop that on the ninth of june
when the sun was setting the old woman had been found in the porch with
her skull broken that beside her in a pool of blood lay an axe when
they looked for nikolay to tell him of the calamity he was not in his
hut or in the streets they ran all over the village looking for him
they went to all the pothouses and huts but could not find him he had
disappeared and two days later came of his own accord to the police
office pale with his clothes torn trembling all over he was bound
and put in the lock up

prisoner said the president addressing harlamov cannot you explain
to the court where you were during the three days following the murder

i was wandering about the fields    neither eating nor drinking  
 

why did you hide yourself if it was not you that committed the
murder

i was frightened    i was afraid i might be judged guilty   

aha    good sit down

the last to be examined was the district doctor who had made a post 
mortem on the old woman he told the court all that he remembered of his
report at the post mortem and all that he had succeeded in thinking of
on his way to the court that morning the president screwed up his eyes
at his new glossy black suit at his foppish cravat at his moving lips
he listened and in his mind the languid thought seemed to spring up of
itself

everyone wears a short jacket nowadays why has he had his made long
why long and not short

the circumspect creak of boots was audible behind the presidents back
it was the assistant prosecutor going up to the table to take some
papers

mihail vladimirovitch said the assistant prosecutor bending down to
the presidents ear amazingly slovenly the way that koreisky conducted
the investigation the prisoners brother was not examined the village
elder was not examined theres no making anything out of his
description of the hut   

it cant be helped it cant be helped said the president sinking
back in his chair hes a wreck    dropping to bits

by the way whispered the assistant prosecutor look at the audience
in the front row the third from the right    a face like an actors
   thats the local croesus he has a fortune of something like fifty
thousand

really you wouldnt guess it from his appearance    well dear
boy shouldnt we have a break

we will finish the case for the prosecution and then   

as you think best    well the president raised his eyes to the
doctor so you consider that death was instantaneous

yes in consequence of the extent of the injury to the brain substance
  

when the doctor had finished the president gazed into the space between
the prosecutor and the counsel for the defence and suggested

have you any questions to ask

the assistant prosecutor shook his head negatively without lifting his
eyes from cain the counsel for the defence unexpectedly stirred and
clearing his throat asked

tell me doctor can you from the dimensions of the wound form any
theory as to    as to the mental condition of the criminal that is
i mean does the extent of the injury justify the supposition that the
accused was suffering from temporary aberration

the president raised his drowsy indifferent eyes to the counsel for the
defence the assistant prosecutor tore himself from cain and looked
at the president they merely looked but there was no smile no
surprise no perplexitytheir faces expressed nothing

perhaps the doctor hesitated if one considers the force with which
   ererer    the criminal strikes the blow    however
excuse me i dont quite understand your question   

the counsel for the defence did not get an answer to his question and
indeed he did not feel the necessity of one it was clear even to
himself that that question had strayed into his mind and found utterance
simply through the effect of the stillness the boredom the whirring
ventilator wheels

when they had got rid of the doctor the court rose to examine the
material evidences the first thing examined was the full skirted
coat upon the sleeve of which there was a dark brownish stain of blood
harlamov on being questioned as to the origin of the stain stated

three days before my old womans death penkov bled his horse i was
there i was helping to be sure and    and got smeared with it  


but penkov has just given evidence that he does not remember that you
were present at the bleeding   

i cant tell about that

sit down

they proceeded to examine the axe with which the old woman had been
murdered

thats not my axe the prisoner declared

whose is it then

i cant tell    i hadnt an axe   

a peasant cant get on for a day without an axe and your neighbour
ivan timofeyitch with whom you mended a sledge has given evidence that
it is your axe   

i cant say about that but i swear before god harlamov held out his
hand before him and spread out the fingers before the living god and
i dont remember how long it is since i did have an axe of my own i did
have one like that only a bit smaller but my son prohor lost it two
years before he went into the army he drove off to fetch wood got
drinking with the fellows and lost it   

good sit down

this systematic distrust and disinclination to hear him probably
irritated and offended harlamov he bblinked and red patches came out on
his cheekbones

i swear in the sight of god he went on craning his neck forward if
you dont believe me be pleased to ask my son prohor proshka what did
you do with the axe he suddenly asked in a rough voice turning
abruptly to the soldier escorting him where is it

it was a painful moment everyone seemed to wince and as it were shrink
together the same fearful incredible thought flashed like lightning
through every head in the court the thought of possibly fatal
coincidence and not one person in the court dared to look at the
soldiers face everyone refused to trust his thought and believed that
he had heard wrong

prisoner conversation with the guards is forbidden    the
president made haste to say

no one saw the escorts face and horror passed over the hall unseen as
in a mask the usher of the court got up quietly from his place and
tiptoeing with his hand held out to balance himself went out of the
court half a minute later there came the muffled sounds and footsteps
that accompany the change of guard

all raised their heads and trying to look as though nothing had
happened went on with their work
