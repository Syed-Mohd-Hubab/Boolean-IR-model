gone astray

a country village wrapped in the darkness of night one oclock strikes
from the belfry two lawyers called kozyavkin and laev both in the
best of spirits and a little unsteady on their legs come out of the
wood and turn towards the cottages

well thank god weve arrived says kozyavkin drawing a deep breath
tramping four miles from the station in our condition is a feat i am
fearfully done up and as ill luck would have it not a fly to be
seen

petya my dear fellow    i cant    i feel like dying if im
not in bed in five minutes

in bed dont you think it my boy first well have supper and a glass
of red wine and then you can go to bed verotchka and i will wake you
up    ah my dear fellow its a fine thing to be married you dont
understand it you cold hearted wretch i shall be home in a minute
worn out and exhausted    a loving wife will welcome me give me
some tea and something to eat and repay me for my hard work and my love
with such a fond and loving look out of her darling black eyes that i
shall forget how tired i am and forget the burglary and the law courts
and the appeal division     its glorious

yes i say i feel as though my legs were dropping off i can scarcely
get along    i am frightfully thirsty   

well here we are at home

the friends go up to one of the cottages and stand still under the
nearest window

its a jolly cottage said kozyavkin you will see to morrow what
views we have theres no light in the windows verotchka must have gone
to bed then she must have got tired of sitting up shes in bed and
must be worrying at my not having turned up he pushes the window with
his stick and it opens plucky girl she goes to bed without bolting
the window he takes off his cape and flings it with his portfolio in
at the window i am hot let us strike up a serenade and make her
laugh he sings the moon floats in the midnight sky    faintly
stir the tender breezes     faintly rustle in the treetops   
sing sing alyosha verotchka shall we sing you schuberts serenade
he sings

his performance is cut short by a sudden fit of coughing tphoo
verotchka tell aksinya to unlock the gate for us a pause
verotchka dont be lazy get up darling he stands on a stone and
looks in at the window verotchka my dumpling verotchka my poppet 
  my little angel my wife beyond compare get up and tell aksinya to
unlock the gate for us you are not asleep you know little wife we
are really so done up and exhausted that were not in the mood for
jokes weve trudged all the way from the station dont you hear ah
hang it all he makes an effort to climb up to the window and falls
down you know this isnt a nice trick to play on a visitor i see you
are just as great a schoolgirl as ever vera you are always up to
mischief

perhaps vera stepanovna is asleep says laev

she isnt asleep i bet she wants me to make an outcry and wake up the
whole neighbourhood im beginning to get cross vera ach damn it all
give me a leg up alyosha ill get in you are a naughty girl nothing
but a regular schoolgirl   give me a hoist

puffing and panting laev gives him a leg up and kozyavkin climbs in at
the window and vanishes into the darkness within

vera laev hears a minute later where are you    d damnation
tphoo ive put my hand into something tphoo

there is a rustling sound a flapping of wings and the desperate
cackling of a fowl

a nice state of things laev hears vera where on earth did these
chickens come from why the devil theres no end of them theres a
basket with a turkey in it    it pecks the nasty creature

two hens fly out of the window and cackling at the top of their voices
flutter down the village street

alyosha weve made a mistake says kozyavkin in a lachrymose voice
there are a lot of hens here    i must have mistaken the house
confound you you are all over the place you cursed brutes

well then make haste and come down do you hear i am dying of
thirst

in a minute    i am looking for my cape and portfolio

light a match

the matches are in the cape    i was a crazy idiot to get into this
place the cottages are exactly alike the devil himself couldnt tell
them apart in the dark aie the turkeys pecked my cheek nasty
creature

make haste and get out or theyll think we are stealing the chickens

in a minute    i cant find my cape anywhere    there are lots
of old rags here and i cant tell where the cape is throw me a match

i havent any

we are in a hole i must say what am i to do i cant go without my
cape and my portfolio i must find them

i cant understand a mans not knowing his own cottage says laev
indignantly drunken beast    if id known i was in for this sort
of thing i would never have come with you i should have been at home
and fast asleep by now and a nice fix im in here    im fearfully
done up and thirsty and my head is going round

in a minute in a minute    you wont expire

a big cock flies crowing over laevs head laev heaves a deep sigh and
with a hopeless gesture sits down on a stone he is beset with a burning
thirst his eyes are closing his head drops forward    five minutes
pass ten twenty and kozyavkin is still busy among the hens

petya will you be long

a minute i found the portfolio but i have lost it again

laev lays his head on his fists and closes his eyes the cackling of
the fowls grows louder and louder the inhabitants of the empty cottage
fly out of the window and flutter round in circles he fancies like
owls over his head his ears ring with their cackle he is overwhelmed
with terror

the beast he thinks he invited me to stay promising me wine and
junket and then he makes me walk from the station and listen to these
hens   

in the midst of his indignation his chin sinks into his collar he lays
his head on his portfolio and gradually subsides weariness gets the
upper hand and he begins to doze

ive found the portfolio he hears kozyavkin cry triumphantly i
shall find the cape in a minute and then off we go

then through his sleep he hears the barking of dogs first one dog
barks then a second and a third    and the barking of the dogs
blends with the cackling of the fowls into a sort of savage music
someone comes up to laev and asks him something then he hears someone
climb over his head into the window then a knocking and a shouting  
 a woman in a red apron stands beside him with a lantern in her hand
and asks him something

youve no right to say so he hears kozyavkins voice i am a lawyer
a bachelor of laws kozyavkin heres my visiting card

what do i want with your card says someone in a husky bass youve
disturbed all my fowls youve smashed the eggs look what youve done
the turkey poults were to have come out to day or to morrow and youve
smashed them whats the use of your giving me your card sir

how dare you interfere with me no i wont have it

i am thirsty thinks laev trying to open his eyes and he feels
somebody climb down from the window over his head

my name is kozyavkin i have a cottage here everyone knows me

we dont know anyone called kozyavkin

what are you saying call the elder he knows me

dont get excited the constable will be here directly    we know
all the summer visitors here but ive never seen you in my life

ive had a cottage in rottendale for five years

whew do you take this for the dale this is sicklystead but
rottendale is farther to the right beyond the match factory its three
miles from here

bless my soul then ive taken the wrong turning

the cries of men and fowls mingle with the barking of dogs and the
voice of kozyavkin rises above the chaos of confused sounds

you shut up ill pay ill show you whom you have to deal with

little by little the voices die down laev feels himself being shaken by
the shoulder
