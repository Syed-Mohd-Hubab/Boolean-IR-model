a troublesome visitor

in the low pitched crooked little hut of artyom the forester two men
were sitting under the big dark ikon artyom himself a short and lean
peasant with a wrinkled aged looking face and a little beard that grew
out of his neck and a well grown young man in a new crimson shirt and
big wading boots who had been out hunting and come in for the night
they were sitting on a bench at a little three legged table on which a
tallow candle stuck into a bottle was lazily burning

outside the window the darkness of the night was full of the noisy
uproar into which nature usually breaks out before a thunderstorm the
wind howled angrily and the bowed trees moaned miserably one pane of
the window had been pasted up with paper and leaves torn off by the
wind could be heard pattering against the paper

i tell you what good christian said artyom in a hoarse little tenor
half whisper staring with unbalinking scared looking eyes at the
hunter i am not afraid of wolves or bears or wild beasts of any sort
but i am afraid of man you can save yourself from beasts with a gun or
some other weapon but you have no means of saving yourself from a
wicked man

to be sure you can fire at a beast but if you shoot at a robber you
will have to answer for it you will go to siberia

ive been forester my lad for thirty years and i couldnt tell you
what i have had to put up with from wicked men there have been lots and
lots of them here the huts on a track its a cart road and that
brings them the devils every sort of ruffian turns up and without
taking off his cap or making the sign of the cross bursts straight in
upon one with give us some bread you old so and so and where am i
to get bread for him what claim has he am i a millionaire to feed
every drunkard that passes they are half blind with spite    they
have no cross on them the devils     theyll give you a clout on
the ear and not think twice about it give us bread well one gives
it    one is not going to fight with them the idols some of them
are two yards across the shoulders and a great fist as big as your
boot and you see the sort of figure i am one of them could smash me
with his little finger    well one gives him bread and he gobbles
it up and stretches out full length across the hut with not a word of
thanks and there are some that ask for money tell me where is your
money as though i had money how should i come by it

a forester and no money laughed the hunter you get wages every
month and ill be bound you sell timber on the sly

artyom took a timid sideway glance at his visitor and twitched his beard
as a magpie twitches her tail

you are still young to say a thing like that to me he said you will
have to answer to god for those words whom may your people be where do
you come from

i am from vyazovka i am the son of nefed the village elder

you have gone out for sport with your gun i used to like sport too
when i was young hm ah our sins are grievous said artyom with a
yawn its a sad thing there are few good folks but villains and
murderers no end god have mercy upon us

you seem to be frightened of me too   

come what next what should i be afraid of you for i see    i
understand    you came in and not just anyhow but you made the
sign of the cross you bowed all decent and proper    i understand
   one can give you bread    i am a widower i dont heat the
stove i sold the samovar    i am too poor to keep meat or anything
else but bread you are welcome to

at that moment something began growling under the bench the growl was
followed by a hiss artyom started drew up his legs and looked
enquiringly at the hunter

its my dog worrying your cat said the hunter you devils he
shouted under the bench lie down youll be beaten i say your cats
thin mate she is nothing but skin and bone

she is old it is time she was dead    so you say you are from
vyazovka

i see you dont feed her though shes a cat shes a creature   
every breathing thing you should have pity on her

you are a queer lot in vyazovka artyom went on as though not
listening the church has been robbed twice in one year   to think
that there are such wicked men so they fear neither man nor god to
steal what is the lords hangings too good for them in old days the
governors used to have such rogues flogged

however you punish whether it is with flogging or anything else it
will be no good you will not knock the wickedness out of a wicked man

save and preserve us queen of heaven the forester sighed abruptly
save us from all enemies and evildoers last week at volovy
zaimishtchy a mower struck another on the chest with his scythe   
he killed him outright and what was it all about god bless me one
mower came out of the tavern    drunk the other met him drunk too

the young man who had been listening attentively suddenly started and
his face grew tense as he listened

stay he said interrupting the forester i fancy someone is
shouting

the hunter and the forester fell to listening with their eyes fixed on
the window through the noise of the forest they could hear sounds such
as the strained ear can always distinguish in every storm so that it
was difficult to make out whether people were calling for help or
whether the wind was wailing in the chimney but the wind tore at the
roof tapped at the paper on the window and brought a distinct shout of
help

talk of your murderers said the hunter turning pale and getting up
someone is being robbed

lord have mercy on us whispered the forester and he too turned
pale and got up

the hunter looked aimlessly out of window and walked up and down the
hut

what a night what a night he muttered you cant see your hand
before your face the very time for a robbery do you hear there is a
shout again

the forester looked at the ikon and from the ikon turned his eyes upon
the hunter and sank on to the bench collapsing like a man terrified by
sudden bad news

good christian he said in a tearful voice you might go into the
passage and bolt the door and we must put out the light

what for

by ill luck they may find their way here    oh our sins

we ought to be going and you talk of bolting the door you are a
clever one are you coming

the hunter threw his gun over his shoulder and picked up his cap

get ready take your gun hey flerka here he called to his dog
flerka

a dog with long frayed ears a mongrel between a setter and a house dog
came out from under the bench he stretched himself by his masters feet
and wagged his tail

why are you sitting there cried the hunter to the forester you mean
to say you are not going

where

to help

how can i said the forester with a wave of his hand shuddering all
over i cant bother about it

why wont you come

after talking of such dreadful things i wont stir a step into the
darkness bless them and what should i go for

what are you afraid of havent you got a gun let us go please do
its scaring to go alone it will be more cheerful the two of us do
you hear there was a shout again get up

whatever do you think of me lad wailed the forester do you think i
am such a fool to go straight to my undoing

so you are not coming

the forester did not answer the dog probably hearing a human cry gave
a plaintive whine

are you coming i ask you cried the hunter rolling his eyes angrily

you do keep on upon my word said the forester with annoyance go
yourself

ugh    low cur growled the hunter turning towards the door
flerka here

he went out and left the door open the wind flew into the hut the
flame of the candle flickered uneasily flared up and went out

as he bolted the door after the hunter the forester saw the puddles in
the track the nearest pine trees and the retreating figure of his
guest lighted up by a flash of lightning far away he heard the rumble
of thunder

holy holy holy whispered the forester making haste to thrust the
thick bolt into the great iron rings what weather the lord has sent
us

going back into the room he felt his way to the stove lay down and
covered himself from head to foot lying under the sheepskin and
listening intently he could no longer hear the human cry but the peals
of thunder kept growing louder and more prolonged he could hear the big
wind lashed raindrops pattering angrily on the panes and on the paper of
the window

hes gone on a fools errand he thought picturing the hunter soaked
with rain and stumbling over the tree stumps i bet his teeth are
chattering with terror

not more than ten minutes later there was a sound of footsteps followed
by a loud knock at the door

whos there cried the forester

its i he heard the young mans voice unfasten the door

the forester clambered down from the stove felt for the candle and
lighting it went to the door the hunter and his dog were drenched to
the skin they had come in for the heaviest of the downpour and now the
water ran from them as from washed clothes before they have been wrung
out

what was it asked the forester

a peasant woman driving in a cart she had got off the road   
answered the young man struggling with his breathlessness she was
caught in a thicket

ah the silly thing she was frightened then    well did you put
her on the road

i dont care to talk to a scoundrel like you

the young man flung his wet cap on the bench and went on

i know now that you are a scoundrel and the lowest of men and you a
keeper too getting a salary you blackguard

the forester slunk with a guilty step to the stove cleared his throat
and lay down the young man sat on the bench thought a little and lay
down on it full length not long afterwards he got up put out the
candle and lay down again during a particularly loud clap of thunder
he turned over spat on the floor and growled out

hes afraid    and what if the woman were being murdered whose
business is it to defend her and he an old man too and a christian 
   hes a pig and nothing else

the forester cleared his throat and heaved a deep sigh somewhere in the
darkness flerka shook his wet coat vigorously which sent drops of water
flying about all over the room

so you wouldnt care if the woman were murdered the hunter went on
well strike me god i had no notion you were that sort of man   

a silence followed the thunderstorm was by now over and the thunder
came from far away but it was still raining

and suppose it hadnt been a woman but you shouting help said the
hunter breaking the silence how would you feel you beast if no one
ran to your aid you have upset me with your meanness plague take you

after another long interval the hunter said

you must have money to be afraid of people a man who is poor is not
likely to be afraid   

for those words you will answer before god artyom said hoarsely from
the stove i have no money

i dare say scoundrels always have money    why are you afraid of
people then so you must have id like to take and rob you for spite
to teach you a lesson   

artyom slipped noiselessly from the stove lighted a candle and sat
down under the holy image he was pale and did not take his eyes off the
hunter

here ill rob you said the hunter getting up what do you think
about it fellows like you want a lesson tell me where is your money
hidden

artyom drew his legs up under him and balinked what are you wriggling
for where is your money hidden have you lost your tongue you fool
why dont you answer

the young man jumped up and went up to the forester

he is balinking like an owl well give me your money or i will shoot
you with my gun

why do you keep on at me squealed the forester and big tears rolled
from his eyes whats the reason of it god sees all you will have to
answer for every word you say to god you have no right whatever to
ask for my money

the young man looked at artyoms tearful face frowned and walked up
and down the hut then angrily clapped his cap on his head and picked up
his gun

ugh    ugh    it makes me sick to look at you he filtered
through his teeth i cant bear the sight of you i wont sleep in your
house anyway good bye hey flerka

the door slammed and the troublesome visitor went out with his dog  
 artyom bolted the door after him crossed himself and lay down
