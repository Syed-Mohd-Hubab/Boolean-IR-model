an enigmatic nature

on the red velvet seat of a first class railway carriage a pretty lady
sits half reclining an expensive fluffy fan trembles in her tightly
closed fingers a pince nez keeps dropping off her pretty little nose
the brooch heaves and falls on her bosom like a boat on the ocean she
is greatly agitated

on the seat opposite sits the provincial secretary of special
commissions a budding young author who from time to time publishes
long stories of high life or novelli as he calls them in the leading
paper of the province he is gazing into her face gazing intently with
the eyes of a connoisseur he is watching studying catching every
shade of this exceptional enigmatic nature he understands it he
fathoms it her soul her whole psychology lies open before him

oh i understand i understand you to your inmost depths says the
secretary of special commissions kissing her hand near the bracelet
your sensitive responsive soul is seeking to escape from the maze of
 yes the struggle is terrific titanic but do not lose heart you
will be triumphant yes

write about me voldemar says the pretty lady with a mournful smile
my life has been so full so varied so chequered above all i am
unhappy i am a suffering soul in some page of dostoevsky reveal my
soul to the world voldemar reveal that hapless soul you are a
psychologist we have not been in the train an hour together and you
have already fathomed my heart

listen my father was a poor clerk in the service he had a good heart
and was not without intelligence but the spirit of the ageof his
environmentvous comprenezi do not blame my poor father he drank
gambled took bribes my motherbut why say more poverty the struggle
for daily bread the consciousness of insignificanceah do not force me
to recall it i had to make my own way you know the monstrous education
at a boarding school foolish novel reading the errors of early youth
the first timid flutter of love it was awful the vacillation and the
agonies of losing faith in life in oneself ah you are an author you
know us women you will understand unhappily i have an intense nature
i looked for happinessand what happiness i longed to set my soul free
yes in that i saw my happiness

exquisite creature murmured the author kissing her hand close to the
bracelet its not you i am kissing but the suffering of humanity do
you remember raskolnikov and his kiss

oh voldemar i longed for glory renown success like everywhy

something extraordinary above the common lot of woman and thenand

voldemar it was self sacrifice renunciation you must see that i
could do nothing else i restored the family fortunes was able to
travel to do good yet how i suffered how revolting how loathsome to
me were his embracesthough i will be fair to himhe had fought nobly in
his day there were momentsterrible momentsbut i was kept up by the
thought that from day to day the old man might die that then i would
begin to live as i liked to give myself to the man i adorebe happy
there is such a man voldemar indeed there is

the pretty lady flutters her fan more violently her face takes a
lachrymose expression she goes on

but at last the old man died he left me something i was free as a
bird of the air now is the moment for me to be happy isnt it
voldemar happiness comes tapping at my window i had only to let it
inbutvoldemar listen i implore you now is the time for me to give
myself to the man i love to become the partner of his life to help to
uphold his ideals to be happyto find restbuthow ignoble repulsive
and senseless all our life is how mean it all is voldemar i am
wretched wretched wretched again there is an obstacle in my path
again i feel that my happiness is far far away ah what anguishif
only you knew what anguish

but whatwhat stands in your way i implore you tell me what is it

another old general very well off

the broken fan conceals the pretty little face the author props on his
fist his thought heavy brow and ponders with the air of a master in
psychology the engine is whistling and hissing while the window
curtains flush red with the glow of the setting sun
