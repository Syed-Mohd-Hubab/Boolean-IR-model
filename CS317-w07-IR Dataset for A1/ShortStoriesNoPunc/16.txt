the jeune premier

yevgeny alexeyitch podzharov the jeune premier a graceful elegant
young man with an oval face and little bags under his eyes had come for
the season to one of the southern towns of russia and tried at once to
make the acquaintance of a few of the leading families of the place
yes signor he would often say gracefully swinging his foot and
displaying his red socks an artist ought to act upon the masses both
directly and indirectly the first aim is attained by his work on the
stage the second by an acquaintance with the local inhabitants on my
honour parole dhonneur i dont understand why it is we actors avoid
making acquaintance with local families why is it to say nothing of
dinners name day parties feasts soires fixes to say nothing of
these entertainments think of the moral influence we may have on
society is it not agreeable to feel one has dropped a spark in some
thick skull the types one meets the women mon dieu what women they
turn ones head one penetrates into some huge merchants house into
the sacred retreats and picks out some fresh and rosy little peachits
heaven parole dhonneur

in the southern town among other estimable families he made the
acquaintance of that of a manufacturer called zybaev whenever he
remembers that acquaintance now he frowns contemptuously screws up his
eyes and nervously plays with his watch chain

one dayit was at a name day party at zybaevsthe actor was sitting in
his new friends drawing room and holding forth as usual around him
types were sitting in armchairs and on the sofa listening affably
from the next room came feminine laughter and the sounds of evening tea
   crossing his legs after each phrase sipping tea with rum in it
and trying to assume an expression of careless boredom he talked of his
stage triumphs

i am a provincial actor principally he said smiling condescendingly
but i have played in petersburg and moscow too    by the way i
will describe an incident which illustrates pretty well the state of
mind of to day at my benefit in moscow the young people brought me such
a mass of laurel wreaths that i swear by all i hold sacred i did not
know where to put them parole dhonneur later on at a moment when
funds were short i took the laurel wreaths to the shop and    guess
what they weighed eighty pounds altogether ha ha you cant think how
useful the money was artists indeed are often hard up to day i have
hundreds thousands tomorrow nothing    to day i havent a crust of
bread to morrow i have oysters and anchovies hang it all

the local inhabitants sipped their glasses decorously and listened the
well pleased host not knowing how to make enough of his cultured and
interesting visitor presented to him a distant relative who had just
arrived one pavel ignatyevitch klimov a bulky gentleman about forty
wearing a long frock coat and very full trousers

you ought to know each other said zybaev as he presented klimov he
loves theatres and at one time used to act himself he has an estate in
the tula province

podzharov and klimov got into conversation it appeared to the great
satisfaction of both that the tula landowner lived in the very town in
which the jeune premier had acted for two seasons in succession
enquiries followed about the town about common acquaintances and about
the theatre   

do you know i like that town awfully said the jeune premier
displaying his red socks what streets what a charming park and what
society delightful society

yes delightful society the landowner assented

a commercial town but extremely cultured    for instance er er er
   the head master of the high school the public prosecutor   
the officers    the police captain too was not bad a man as the
french say enchant and the women allah what women

yes the women    certainly   

perhaps i am partial the fact is that in your town i dont know why
i was devilishly lucky with the fair sex i could write a dozen novels
to take this episode for instance    i was staying in yegoryevsky
street in the very house where the treasury is   

the red house without stucco

yes yes    without stucco    close by as i remember now lived
a local beauty varenka   

not varvara nikolayevna asked klimov and he beamed with
satisfaction she really is a beauty    the most beautiful girl in
the town

the most beautiful girl in the town a classic profile great black
eyes     and hair to her waist she saw me in hamlet she wrote me
a letter   la pushkins tatyana    i answered as you may guess
  

podzharov looked round and having satisfied himself that there were no
ladies in the room rolled his eyes smiled mournfully and heaved a
sigh

i came home one evening after a performance he whispered and there
she was sitting on my sofa there followed tears protestations of
love kisses    oh that was a marvellous that was a divine night
our romance lasted two months but that night was never repeated it was
a night parole dhonneur

excuse me whats that muttered klimov turning crimson and gazing
open eyed at the actor i know varvara nikolayevna well shes my
niece

podzharov was embarrassed and he too opened his eyes wide

hows this klimov went on throwing up his hands i know the girl
and    and    i am surprised   

i am very sorry this has come up muttered the actor getting up and
rubbing something out of his left eye with his little finger though
of course    of course you as her uncle   

the other guests who had hitherto been listening to the actor with
pleasure and rewarding him with smiles were embarrassed and dropped
their eyes

please do be so good    take your words back    said klimov in
extreme embarrassment i beg you to do so

if    er er er    it offends you certainly answered the actor
with an undefined movement of his hand

and confess you have told a falsehood

i no    er er er    it was not a lie but i greatly regret
having spoken too freely    and in fact    i dont understand
your tone

klimov walked up and down the room in silence as though in uncertainty
and hesitation his fleshy face grew more and more crimson and the
veins in his neck swelled up after walking up and down for about two
minutes he went up to the actor and said in a tearful voice

no do be so good as to confess that you told a lie about varenka have
the goodness to do so

its queer said the actor with a strained smile shrugging his
shoulders and swinging his leg this is positively insulting

so you will not confess it

i do ont understand

you will not in that case excuse me    i shall have to resort to
unpleasant measures either sir i shall insult you at once on the
spot or    if you are an honourable man you will kindly accept my
challenge to a duel    we will fight

certainly rapped out the jeune premier with a contemptuous gesture
certainly

extremely perturbed the guests and the host not knowing what to do
drew klimov aside and began begging him not to get up a scandal
astonished feminine countenances appeared in the doorway    the
jeune premier turned round said a few words and with an air of being
unable to remain in a house where he was insulted took his cap and made
off without saying good bye

on his way home the jeune premier smiled contemptuously and shrugged his
shoulders but when he reached his hotel room and stretched himself on
his sofa he felt exceedingly uneasy

the devil take him he thought a duel does not matter he wont kill
me but the trouble is the other fellows will hear of it and they know
perfectly well it was a yarn its abominable i shall be disgraced all
over russia   

podzharov thought a little smoked and to calm himself went out into
the street

i ought to talk to this bully ram into his stupid noddle that he is a
blockhead and a fool and that i am not in the least afraid of him  


the jeune premier stopped before zybaevs house and looked at the
windows lights were still burning behind the muslin curtains and
figures were moving about

ill wait for him the actor decided

it was dark and cold a hateful autumn rain was drizzling as though
through a sieve podzharov leaned his elbow on a lamp post and abandoned
himself to a feeling of uneasiness

he was wet through and exhausted

at two oclock in the night the guests began coming out of zybaevs
house the landowner from tula was the last to make his appearance he
heaved a sigh that could be heard by the whole street and scraped the
pavement with his heavy overboots

excuse me said the jeune premier overtaking him one minute

klimov stopped the actor gave a smile hesitated and began
stammering i    i confess    i told a lie

no sir you will please confess that publicly said klimov and he
turned crimson again i cant leave it like that   

but you see i am apologizing i beg you    dont you understand i
beg you because you will admit a duel will make talk and i am in a
position    my fellow actors    goodness knows what they may
think   

the jeune premier tried to appear unconcerned to smile to stand erect
but his body would not obey him his voice trembled his eyes balinked
guiltily and his head drooped for a good while he went on muttering
something klimov listened to him thought a little and heaved a sigh

well so be it he said may god forgive you only dont lie in
future young man nothing degrades a man like lying    yes indeed
you are a young man you have had a good education   

the landowner from tula in a benignant fatherly way gave him a
lecture while the jeune premier listened and smiled meekly    when
it was over he smirked bowed and with a guilty step and a crestfallen
air set off for his hotel

as he went to bed half an hour later he felt that he was out of danger
and was already in excellent spirits serene and satisfied that the
misunderstanding had ended so satisfactorily he wrapped himself in the
bedclothes soon fell asleep and slept soundly till ten oclock next
morning
