a slander

serge kapitonich ahineev the writing master was marrying his daughter
to the teacher of history and geography the wedding festivities were
going off most successfully in the drawing room there was singing
playing and dancing waiters hired from the club were flitting
distractedly about the rooms dressed in black swallow tails and dirty
white ties there was a continual hubbub and din of conversation
sitting side by side on the sofa the teacher of mathematics
tarantulov the french teacher pasdequoi and the junior assessor of
taxes mzda were talking hurriedly and interrupting one another as they
described to the guests cases of persons being buried alive and gave
their opinions on spiritualism none of them believed in spiritualism
but all admitted that there were many things in this world which would
always be beyond the mind of man in the next room the literature
master dodonsky was explaining to the visitors the cases in which a
sentry has the right to fire on passers by the subjects as you
perceive were alarming but very agreeable persons whose social
position precluded them from entering were looking in at the windows
from the yard

just at midnight the master of the house went into the kitchen to see
whether everything was ready for supper the kitchen from floor to
ceiling was filled with fumes composed of goose duck and many other
odours on two tables the accessories the drinks and light
refreshments were set out in artistic disorder the cook marfa a red 
faced woman whose figure was like a barrel with a belt around it was
bustling about the tables

show me the sturgeon marfa said ahineev rubbing his hands and
licking his lips what a perfume i could eat up the whole kitchen
come show me the sturgeon

marfa went up to one of the benches and cautiously lifted a piece of
greasy newspaper under the paper on an immense dish there reposed a
huge sturgeon masked in jelly and decorated with capers olives and
carrots ahineev gazed at the sturgeon and gasped his face beamed he
turned his eyes up he bent down and with his lips emitted the sound of
an ungreased wheel after standing a moment he snapped his fingers with
delight and once more smacked his lips

ah ah the sound of a passionate kiss    who is it youre kissing
out there little marfa came a voice from the next room and in the
doorway there appeared the cropped head of the assistant usher vankin
who is it a a h    delighted to meet you sergei kapitonich
youre a fine grandfather i must say tte   tte with the fair
sextette

im not kissing said ahineev in confusion who told you so you
fool i was only    i smacked my lips    in reference to    as
an indication of    pleasure    at the sight of the fish

tell that to the marines the intrusive face vanished wearing a broad
grin

ahineev flushed

hang it he thought the beast will go now and talk scandal hell
disgrace me to all the town the brute

ahineev went timidly into the drawing room and looked stealthily round
for vankin vankin was standing by the piano and bending down with a
jaunty air was whispering something to the inspectors sister in law
who was laughing

talking about me thought ahineev about me blast him and she
believes it    believes it she laughs mercy on us no i cant let
it pass    i cant i must do something to prevent his being
believed    ill speak to them all and hell be shown up for a fool
and a gossip

ahineev scratched his head and still overcome with embarrassment went
up to pasdequoi

ive just been in the kitchen to see after the supper he said to the
frenchman i know you are fond of fish and ive a sturgeon my dear
fellow beyond everything a yard and a half long ha ha ha and by
the way    i was just forgetting    in the kitchen just now with
that sturgeon    quite a little story i went into the kitchen just
now and wanted to look at the supper dishes i looked at the sturgeon
and i smacked my lips with relish    at the piquancy of it and at
the very moment that fool vankin came in and said    ha ha ha 
  so youre kissing here kissing marfa the cook what a thing to
imagine silly fool the woman is a perfect fright like all the beasts
put together and he talks about kissing queer fish

whos a queer fish asked tarantulov coming up

why he over therevankin i went into the kitchen   

and he told the story of vankin    he amused me queer fish id
rather kiss a dog than marfa if you ask me added ahineev he looked
round and saw behind him mzda

we were talking of vankin he said queer fish he is he went into
the kitchen saw me beside marfa and began inventing all sorts of silly
stories why are you kissing he says he must have had a drop too
much and id rather kiss a turkeycock than marfa i said and ive a
wife of my own you fool said i he did amuse me

who amused you asked the priest who taught scripture in the school
going up to ahineev

vankin i was standing in the kitchen you know looking at the
sturgeon   

and so on within half an hour or so all the guests knew the incident of
the sturgeon and vankin

let him tell away now thought ahineev rubbing his hands let him
hell begin telling his story and theyll say to him at once enough of
your improbable nonsense you fool we know all about it

and ahineev was so relieved that in his joy he drank four glasses too
many after escorting the young people to their room he went to bed and
slept like an innocent babe and next day he thought no more of the
incident with the sturgeon but alas man proposes but god disposes
an evil tongue did its evil work and ahineevs strategy was of no
avail just a week laterto be precise on wednesday after the third
lessonwhen ahineev was standing in the middle of the teachers room
holding forth on the vicious propensities of a boy called visekin the
head master went up to him and drew him aside

look here sergei kapitonich said the head master you must excuse
me    its not my business but all the same i must make you
realize    its my duty you see there are rumors that you are
romancing with that    cook    its nothing to do with me but 
  flirt with her kiss her    as you please but dont let it be so
public please i entreat you dont forget that youre a schoolmaster

ahineev turned cold and faint he went home like a man stung by a whole
swarm of bees like a man scalded with boiling water as he walked home
it seemed to him that the whole town was looking at him as though he
were smeared with pitch at home fresh trouble awaited him

why arent you gobbling up your food as usual his wife asked him at
dinner what are you so pensive about brooding over your amours
pining for your marfa i know all about it mohammedan kind friends
have opened my eyes o o o    you savage

and she slapped him in the face he got up from the table not feeling
the earth under his feet and without his hat or coat made his way to
vankin he found him at home

you scoundrel he addressed him why have you covered me with mud
before all the town why did you set this slander going about me

what slander what are you talking about

who was it gossiped of my kissing marfa wasnt it you tell me that
wasnt it you you brigand

vankin balinked and twitched in every fibre of his battered countenance
raised his eyes to the icon and articulated god blast me strike me
blind and lay me out if i said a single word about you may i be left
without house and home may i be stricken with worse than cholera

vankins sincerity did not admit of doubt it was evidently not he who
was the author of the slander

but who then who ahineev wondered going over all his acquaintances
in his mind and beating himself on the breast who then

who then we too ask the reader
