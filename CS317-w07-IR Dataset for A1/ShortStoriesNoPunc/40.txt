the album

kraterov the titular councillor as thin and slender as the admiralty
spire stepped forward and addressing zhmyhov said

your excellency moved and touched to the bottom of our hearts by the
way you have ruled us during long years and by your fatherly care  


during the course of more than ten years   zakusin prompted

during the course of more than ten years we your subordinates on
this so memorable for us    er    day beg your excellency to
accept in token of our respect and profound gratitude this album with
our portraits in it and express our hope that for the duration of your
distinguished life that for long long years to come to your dying day
you may not abandon us   

with your fatherly guidance in the path of justice and progress  
added zakusin wiping from his brow the perspiration that had suddenly
appeared on it he was evidently longing to speak and in all
probability had a speech ready and he wound up may your standard
fly for long long years in the career of genius industry and social
self consciousness

a tear trickled down the wrinkled left cheek of zhmyhov

gentlemen he said in a shaking voice i did not expect i had no
idea that you were going to celebrate my modest jubilee    i am
touched indeed    very much so    i shall not forget this moment
to my dying day and believe me    believe me friends that no one
is so desirous of your welfare as i am    and if there has been
anything    it was for your benefit

zhmyhov the actual civil councillor kissed the titular councillor
kraterov who had not expected such an honour and turned pale with
delight then the chief made a gesture that signified that he could not
speak for emotion and shed tears as though an expensive album had not
been presented to him but on the contrary taken from him     then
when he had a little recovered and said a few more words full of feeling
and given everyone his hand to shake he went downstairs amid loud and
joyful cheers got into his carriage and drove off followed by their
blessings as he sat in his carriage he was aware of a flood of joyous
feelings such as he had never known before and once more he shed tears

at home new delights awaited him there his family his friends and
acquaintances had prepared him such an ovation that it seemed to him
that he really had been of very great service to his country and that
if he had never existed his country would perhaps have been in a very
bad way the jubilee dinner was made up of toasts speeches and tears
in short zhmyhov had never expected that his merits would be so warmly
appreciated

gentlemen he said before the dessert two hours ago i was
recompensed for all the sufferings a man has to undergo who is the
servant so to say not of routine not of the letter but of duty
through the whole duration of my service i have constantly adhered to
the principle the public does not exist for us but we for the public
and to day i received the highest reward my subordinates presented me
with an album    see i was touched

festive faces bent over the album and began examining it

its a pretty album said zhmyhovs daughter olya it must have cost
fifty roubles i do believe oh its charming you must give me the
album papa do you hear ill take care of it its so pretty

after dinner olya carried off the album to her room and shut it up in
her table drawer next day she took the clerks out of it flung them on
the floor and put her school friends in their place the government
uniforms made way for white pelerines kolya his excellencys little
son picked up the clerks and painted their clothes red those who had
no moustaches he presented with green moustaches and added brown beards
to the beardless when there was nothing left to paint he cut the little
men out of the card board pricked their eyes with a pin and began
playing soldiers with them after cutting out the titular councillor
kraterov he fixed him on a match box and carried him in that state to
his fathers study

papa a monument look

zhmyhov burst out laughing lurched forward and looking tenderly at
the child gave him a warm kiss on the cheek

there you rogue go and show mamma let mamma look too
