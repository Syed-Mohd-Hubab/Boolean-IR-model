a defenceless creature

in spite of a violent attack of gout in the night and the nervous
exhaustion left by it kistunov went in the morning to his office and
began punctually seeing the clients of the bank and persons who had come
with petitions he looked languid and exhausted and spoke in a faint
voice hardly above a whisper as though he were dying

what can i do for you he asked a lady in an antediluvian mantle
whose back view was extremely suggestive of a huge dung beetle

you see your excellency the petitioner in question began speaking
rapidly my husband shtchukin a collegiate assessor was ill for five
months and while he if you will excuse my saying so was laid up at
home he was for no sort of reason dismissed your excellency and when
i went for his salary they deducted if you please your excellency
twenty four roubles thirty six kopecks from his salary what for i
asked he borrowed from the club fund they told me and the other
clerks had stood security for him how was that how could he have
borrowed it without my consent its impossible your excellency whats
the reason of it i am a poor woman i earn my bread by taking in
lodgers i am a weak defenceless woman    i have to put up with ill 
usage from everyone and never hear a kind word  

the petitioner was balinking and dived into her mantle for her
handkerchief kistunov took her petition from her and began reading it

excuse me whats this he asked shrugging his shoulders i can make
nothing of it evidently you have come to the wrong place madam your
petition has nothing to do with us at all you will have to apply to the
department in which your husband was employed

why my dear sir i have been to five places already and they would
not even take the petition anywhere said madame shtchukin id quite
lost my head but thank goodnessgod bless him for itmy son in law
boris matveyitch advised me to come to you you go to mr kistunov
mamma he is an influential man he can do anything for you    help
me your excellency

we can do nothing for you madame shtchukin you must understand your
husband served in the army medical department and our establishment is
a purely private commercial undertaking a bank surely you must
understand that

kistunov shrugged his shoulders again and turned to a gentleman in a
military uniform with a swollen face

your excellency piped madame shtchukin in a pitiful voice i have
the doctors certificate that my husband was ill here it is if you
will kindly look at it

very good i believe you kistunov said irritably but i repeat it
has nothing to do with us its queer and positively absurd surely your
husband must know where you are to apply

he knows nothing your excellency he keeps on its not your
business get awaythats all i can get out of him    whose
business is it then its i have to keep them all

kistunov again turned to madame shtchukin and began explaining to her
the difference between the army medical department and a private bank
she listened attentively nodded in token of assent and said

yes    yes    yes    i understand sir in that case your
excellency tell them to pay me fifteen roubles at least i agree to
take part on account

ough sighed kistunov letting his head drop back theres no making
you see reason do understand that to apply to us with such a petition
is as strange as to send in a petition concerning divorce for instance
to a chemists or to the assaying board you have not been paid your
due but what have we to do with it

your excellency make me remember you in my prayers for the rest of my
days have pity on a lone lorn woman wailed madame shtchukin i am a
weak defenceless woman    i am worried to death ive to settle
with the lodgers and see to my husbands affairs and fly round looking
after the house and i am going to church every day this week and my
son in law is out of a job    i might as well not eat or drink  
 i can scarcely keep on my feet    i havent slept all night  


kistunov was conscious of the palpitation of his heart with a face of
anguish pressing his hand on his heart he began explaining to madame
shtchukin again but his voice failed him

no excuse me i cannot talk to you he said with a wave of his hand
my heads going round you are hindering us and wasting your time
ough alexey nikolaitch he said addressing one of his clerks please
will you explain to madame shtchukin

kistunov passing by all the petitioners went to his private room and
signed about a dozen papers while alexey nikolaitch was still engaged
with madame shtchukin as he sat in his room kistunov heard two voices
the monotonous restrained bass of alexey nikolaitch and the shrill
wailing voice of madame shtchukin

i am a weak defenceless woman i am a woman in delicate health said
madame shtchukin i look strong but if you were to overhaul me there
is not one healthy fibre in me i can scarcely keep on my feet and my
appetite is gone    i drank my cup of coffee this morning without
the slightest relish   

alexey nikolaitch explained to her the difference between the
departments and the complicated system of sending in papers he was soon
exhausted and his place was taken by the accountant

a wonderfully disagreeable woman said kistunov revolted nervously
cracking his fingers and continually going to the decanter of water
shes a perfect idiot shes worn me out and shell exhaust them the
nasty creature ough    my heart is throbbing

half an hour later he rang his bell alexey nikolaitch made his
appearance

how are things going kistunov asked languidly

we cant make her see anything pyotr alexandritch we are simply done
we talk of one thing and she talks of something else

i    i cant stand the sound of her voice    i am ill     i
cant bear it

send for the porter pyotr alexandritch let him put her out

no no cried kistunov in alarm she will set up a squeal and there
are lots of flats in this building and goodness knows what they would
think of us    do try and explain to her my dear fellow   

a minute later the deep drone of alexey nikolaitchs voice was audible
again a quarter of an hour passed and instead of his bass there was
the murmur of the accountants powerful tenor

re mark ably nasty woman kistunov thought indignantly nervously
shrugging his shoulders no more brains than a sheep i believe thats
a twinge of the gout again    my migraine is coming back   

in the next room alexey nikolaitch at the end of his resources at last
tapped his finger on the table and then on his own forehead

the fact of the matter is you havent a head on your shoulders he
said but this

come come said the old lady offended talk to your own wife like
that    you screw    dont be too free with your hands

and looking at her with fury with exasperation as though he would
devour her alexey nikolaitch said in a quiet stifled voice

clear out

wha at squealed madame shtchukin how dare you i am a weak
defenceless woman i wont endure it my husband is a collegiate
assessor you screw    i will go to dmitri karlitch the lawyer and
there will be nothing left of you ive had the law of three lodgers
and i will make you flop down at my feet for your saucy words ill go
to your general your excellency your excellency

be off you pest hissed alexey nikolaitch

kistunov opened his door and looked into the office

what is it he asked in a tearful voice

madame shtchukin as red as a crab was standing in the middle of the
room rolling her eyes and prodding the air with her fingers the bank
clerks were standing round red in the face too and evidently harassed
were looking at each other distractedly

your excellency cried madame shtchukin pouncing upon kistunov
here this man he here    this man    she pointed to alexey
nikolaitch tapped himself on the forehead and then tapped the table 
  you told him to go into my case and hes jeering at me i am a
weak defenceless woman    my husband is a collegiate assessor and
i am a majors daughter myself

very good madam moaned kistunov i will go into it    i will
take steps    go away    later

and when shall i get the money your excellency i need it to day

kistunov passed his trembling hand over his forehead heaved a sigh and
began explaining again

madam i have told you already this is a bank a private commercial
establishment    what do you want of us and do understand that you
are hindering us

madame shtchukin listened to him and sighed

to be sure to be sure she assented only your excellency do me
the kindness make me pray for you for the rest of my life be a father
protect me if a medical certificate is not enough i can produce an
affidavit from the police    tell them to give me the money

everything began swimming before kistunovs eyes he breathed out all
the air in his lungs in a prolonged sigh and sank helpless on a chair

how much do you want he asked in a weak voice

twenty four roubles and thirty six kopecks

kistunov took his pocket book out of his pocket extracted a twenty five
rouble note and gave it to madame shtchukin

take it and    and go away

madame shtchukin wrapped the money up in her handkerchief put it away
and pursing up her face into a sweet mincing even coquettish smile
asked

your excellency and would it be possible for my husband to get a post
again

i am going    i am ill    said kistunov in a weary voice i
have dreadful palpitations

when he had driven home alexey nikolaitch sent nikita for some laurel
drops and after taking twenty drops each all the clerks set to work
while madame shtchukin stayed another two hours in the vestibule
talking to the porter and waiting for kistunov to return   

she came again next day
