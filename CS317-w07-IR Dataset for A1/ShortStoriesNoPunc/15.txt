an avenger

shortly after finding his wife in flagrante delicto fyodor fyodorovitch
sigaev was standing in schmuck and cos the gunsmiths selecting a
suitable revolver his countenance expressed wrath grief and
unalterable determination

i know what i must do he was thinking the sanctities of the home
are outraged honour is trampled in the mud vice is triumphant and
therefore as a citizen and a man of honour i must be their avenger
first i will kill her and her lover and then myself

he had not yet chosen a revolver or killed anyone but already in
imagination he saw three bloodstained corpses broken skulls brains
oozing from them the commotion the crowd of gaping spectators the
post mortem    with the malignant joy of an insulted man he pictured
the horror of the relations and the public the agony of the traitress
and was mentally reading leading articles on the destruction of the
traditions of the home

the shopman a sprightly little frenchified figure with rounded belly
and white waistcoat displayed the revolvers and smiling respectfully
and scraping with his little feet observed

   i would advise you msieur to take this superb revolver the
smith and wesson pattern the last word in the science of firearms
triple action with ejector kills at six hundred paces central sight
let me draw your attention msieu to the beauty of the finish the
most fashionable system msieu we sell a dozen every day for burglars
wolves and lovers very correct and powerful action hits at a great
distance and kills wife and lover with one bullet as for suicide
msieu i dont know a better pattern

the shopman pulled and cocked the trigger breathed on the barrel took
aim and affected to be breathless with delight looking at his ecstatic
countenance one might have supposed that he would readily have put a
bullet through his brains if he had only possessed a revolver of such a
superb pattern as a smith wesson

and what price asked sigaev

forty five roubles msieu

mm    thats too dear for me

in that case msieu let me offer you another make somewhat cheaper
here if youll kindly look we have an immense choice at all prices 
  here for instance this revolver of the lefaucher pattern costs
only eighteen roubles but    the shopman pursed up his face
contemptuously    but msieu its an old fashioned make they are
only bought by hysterical ladies or the mentally deficient to commit
suicide or shoot ones wife with a lefaucher revolver is considered bad
form nowadays smith wesson is the only pattern thats correct style

i dont want to shoot myself or to kill anyone said sigaev lying
sullenly i am buying it simply for a country cottage    to frighten
away burglars   

thats not our business what object you have in buying it the
shopman smiled dropping his eyes discreetly if we were to investigate
the object in each case msieu we should have to close our shop to
frighten burglars lefaucher is not a suitable pattern msieu for it
goes off with a faint muffled sound i would suggest mortimers the
so called duelling pistol   

shouldnt i challenge him to a duel flashed through sigaevs mind
its doing him too much honour though    beasts like that are
killed like dogs   

the shopman swaying gracefully and tripping to and fro on his little
feet still smiling and chattering displayed before him a heap of
revolvers the most inviting and impressive of all was the smith and
wessons sigaev picked up a pistol of that pattern gazed blankly at
it and sank into brooding his imagination pictured how he would blow
out their brains how blood would flow in streams over the rug and the
parquet how the traitresss legs would twitch in her last agony   
but that was not enough for his indignant soul the picture of blood
wailing and horror did not satisfy him he must think of something more
terrible

i know ill kill myself and him he thought but ill leave her
alive let her pine away from the stings of conscience and the contempt
of all surrounding her for a sensitive nature like hers that will be
far more agonizing than death

and he imagined his own funeral he the injured husband lies in his
coffin with a gentle smile on his lips and she pale tortured by
remorse follows the coffin like a niobe not knowing where to hide
herself to escape from the withering contemptuous looks cast upon her
by the indignant crowd

i see msieu that you like the smith and wesson make the shopman
broke in upon his broodings if you think it too dear very well ill
knock off five roubles    but we have other makes cheaper

the little frenchified figure turned gracefully and took down another
dozen cases of revolvers from the shelf

here msieu price thirty roubles thats not expensive especially as
the rate of exchange has dropped terribly and the customs duties are
rising every hour msieu i vow i am a conservative but even i am
beginning to murmur why with the rate of exchange and the customs
tariff only the rich can purchase firearms theres nothing left for
the poor but tula weapons and phosphorus matches and tula weapons are a
misery you may aim at your wife with a tula revolver and shoot yourself
through the shoulder blade

sigaev suddenly felt mortified and sorry that he would be dead and
would miss seeing the agonies of the traitress revenge is only sweet
when one can see and taste its fruits and what sense would there be in
it if he were lying in his coffin knowing nothing about it

hadnt i better do this he pondered ill kill him then ill go to
his funeral and look on and after the funeral ill kill myself theyd
arrest me though before the funeral and take away my pistol   
and so ill kill him she shall remain alive and i    for the time
ill not kill myself but go and be arrested i shall always have time
to kill myself there will be this advantage about being arrested that
at the preliminary investigation i shall have an opportunity of exposing
to the authorities and to the public all the infamy of her conduct if i
kill myself she may with her characteristic duplicity and impudence
throw all the blame on me and society will justify her behaviour and
will very likely laugh at me    if i remain alive then   

a minute later he was thinking

yes if i kill myself i may be blamed and suspected of petty feeling 
  besides why should i kill myself thats one thing and for
another to shoot oneself is cowardly and so ill kill him and let her
live and ill face my trial i shall be tried and she will be brought
into court as a witness    i can imagine her confusion her disgrace
when she is examined by my counsel the sympathies of the court of the
press and of the public will certainly be with me

while he deliberated the shopman displayed his wares and felt it
incumbent upon him to entertain his customer

here are english ones a new pattern only just received he prattled
on but i warn you msieu all these systems pale beside the smith and
wesson the other day as i dare say you have read an officer bought from
us a smith and wesson he shot his wifes lover and would you believe
it the bullet passed through him pierced the bronze lamp then the
piano and ricochetted back from the piano killing the lap dog and
bruising the wife a magnificent record redounding to the honour of our
firm the officer is now under arrest he will no doubt be convicted and
sent to penal servitude in the first place our penal code is quite out
of date and secondly msieu the sympathies of the court are always
with the lover why is it very simple msieu the judges and the jury
and the prosecutor and the counsel for the defence are all living with
other mens wives and itll add to their comfort that there will be one
husband the less in russia society would be pleased if the government
were to send all the husbands to sahalin oh msieu you dont know how
it excites my indignation to see the corruption of morals nowadays to
love other mens wives is as much the regular thing to day as to smoke
other mens cigarettes and to read other mens books every year our
trade gets worse and worse it doesnt mean that wives are more faithful
but that husbands resign themselves to their position and are afraid of
the law and penal servitude

the shopman looked round and whispered and whose fault is it msieu
the governments

to go to sahalin for the sake of a pig like that theres no sense in
that either sigaev pondered if i go to penal servitude it will only
give my wife an opportunity of marrying again and deceiving a second
husband she would triumph    and so i will leave her alive i wont
kill myself him    i wont kill either i must think of something
more sensible and more effective i will punish them with my contempt
and will take divorce proceedings that will make a scandal

here msieu is another make said the shopman taking down another
dozen from the shelf let me call your attention to the original
mechanism of the lock

in view of his determination a revolver was now of no use to sigaev but
the shopman meanwhile getting more and more enthusiastic persisted in
displaying his wares before him the outraged husband began to feel
ashamed that the shopman should be taking so much trouble on his account
for nothing that he should be smiling wasting time displaying
enthusiasm for nothing

very well in that case he muttered ill look in again later on  
 or ill send someone

he didnt see the expression of the shopmans face but to smooth over
the awkwardness of the position a little he felt called upon to make
some purchase but what should he buy he looked round the walls of the
shop to pick out something inexpensive and his eyes rested on a green
net hanging near the door

thats    whats that he asked

thats a net for catching quails

and what price is it

eight roubles msieu

wrap it up for me   

the outraged husband paid his eight roubles took the net and feeling
even more outraged walked out of the shop
